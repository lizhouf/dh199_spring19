Canaghquieson, Chief of Oneida, stood up & addressing all present, observed that the several American Governors had Indian Names, by which they were known to the Indians, the Governor of New Jersey excepted; that he therefore thought it necessary to compliment him with a name, which he did by bestowing his own name upon him, on which his Excellency Governor [William] Franklin shook him by the hand & returned him thanks. Then Canaghquieson proceeded to answer the ceremony of Condolence as follows. Brother, We congratulate you, the Governor and the rest of the Gentlemen, on your safe arrival at this Place, where we are heartily glad to meet you. Then after repeating what Sir William had said on the first strings, yesterday, he said, they did on their parts wipe away the Tears which their Brothers the English were shedding for their losses as also the blood of their friends from their seats, cleansing their hearts that they may be able to attend the important affairs which were to be transacted.

Brother, We are much concerned at the losses you have met with since our last Congress, and we sincerely condole with you upon the occasion for them all. A Belt of 9 Rows. Brother, We thank you for rekindling our several Council Fires, whereby we are enabled to proceed to business as formerly, and we shall endeavour to render our Meetings useful to the Public. A Belt. Brother, We thank you for the advice you give us, to assemble duly when the publick affairs require it, and we assure you that we will direct our thoughts, to the maintenance of Peace and good order. A Belt. Brother, We are much obliged to you for dispelling the darkness that surrounded our several Nations on account of our many losses. This we take very kindly of you, as we were in great heaviness for some time past, and all our Nations join in thanking you and performing the same on their parts. A Belt. Brother, We all express our thanks to you for the remembrance of our ancient ceremonies. We consider them as the cement of our union, and as you have cleansed us with water, we do in like manner take of the clearest running stream & wash your inside thoroughly therewith cleansing you from all impurities. A Belt. Brother, We esteem the advice you have given our chiefs to consult the young men as occasion may require, and your directions that they should on their parts pay due regard to us, and we shall observe whatever you have recommended to us A Belt. Brother, We are sensible that we have but two great Council Fires, the one at your house, the other at Onondaga, We shall always be ready to attend at either for the public Good, and we hope that you will continue to be ready to meet us often as the general Peace requires it A Belt. Brother, We give you thanks for recommending unanimity to us. We know that our living together is necessary to our happiness and that it gives us strength. We will follow your advice, and we recommend it to the English to be unanimous in all good works. A Belt. Brother, We are happy to find you so observant of our ancient Customs, that you give us a string in a Pouch to make use of when we have occasion to communicate our losses and condole for them. We request you will be equally observant of these matters, that so our Grief may be timely and properly removed. A Belt. Brother, We also give you many thanks for supplying us with a Torch to travel with on emergencies. We assure that we shall make proper use of it, & communicate every necessary intelligence to you.

The Ceremony of condolence being ended, Sir William gave them a short exhortation after which the Chiefs arose and shook hands with Governor Franklin & Canaghquieson addressing him said, that as he had given him his own name, he hoped that they would endeavour to acquire as much reputation with it amongst the People as he had done. The Governor returned them many thanks. At a Congress Wednesday Oct. 26. PRESENT — as before. Canaghquieson stood up and said that the Six Nations not being satisfied with his having given his own name to Governor Franklin had met upon it, and in testimony of their sense of his, and his Peoples justice in causing the murderers of some Indians to be put to death within his Government did now confer upon him the name of Sagorighweyoghsta, or the Great Arbiter or Doer of Justice, wishing that he and the people of his Government might continue to act with the same Justice they had hitherto done.",0.036,0.155,0.809,0.9989,False,True,1768,10,24,1768,11,5

The Indians continued in private Council till 4 P. M. when they sent to let Sir William know, that they would be glad to speak with him: being all seated the Speaker addressed Sir William. Brother, We have been for some time deliberating on what you said concerning a Line between the English and us, & we are sensible it would be for our mutual advantage if it were not transgressed, but daily experience teaches us that we cannot have any great dependance on the white People, and that they will forget their agreements for the sake of our Lands — However you have said so much to us upon it that we are willing to believe more favorably in this case. Brother, You remember when we spoke last concerning this Boundary, that we did not agree about the way it should run from Oswego  — This is a point that must now be settled for to what purpose could it be to draw a Line between us & the country of Virginia & Pennsylvania whilst the way to our Towns lay open. We would therefore know what you intend to propose as a Boundary to the Northward that we take it into consideration and we shall be glad that you explain it fully to us, that no mistake may be made on either side.",0.062,0.056,0.882,-0.3327,True,False,1768,10,24,1768,11,5

Brother, Before we answer you about the continuation of the Line we must say something to you concerning the extent of it to the Southward which we find is no further than Kanhawa River. Now Brother, you, who know all our affairs, must be sensible that our Rights go much farther to the Southward and that we have a very good & clear Title to the Lands as far as the Cherokee River which we can not allow to be right of any other Indians without doing wrong to our Posterity and acting unworthy those Warriors who fought & conquered it. We therefore expect this our Right will be considered. Brother, We are now to speak about continuing the Line as you said from Delaware so as to close it, and you recommend it to us to give you plenty for the people. We were formerly generous & gave the white people in many places Lands when they were too poor to buy them. We have often had bad Returns. Nevertheless, we would still act generously and mean to do as much as we can without ruining our Children. Brother, You know that the country from Oswego quite to Oswego is full of our Towns & Villages and that it is very dear to us so that we cannot be expected to part with what lies at our Doors, besides your people are come already too close to us. We therefore think that the Line should run up the Delaware to the Swamp & from that run across to the Governor Cosbys Land and then go away to Lake George which we can not but think a fair offer.",0.081,0.103,0.817,0.846,False,True,1768,10,24,1768,11,5
5,1768.txt,Treaty of Fort Stanwix,1768-10-24,1768-11-05,Rome,NY,Native Speakers,,Native,,"At night several of the Chiefs came to Sir William's Quarters to let him know the purport of Intelligence and Belts received from the Shawanese, which was that according to the old agreement subsisting between the several Indian Nations, they were all to unite and attack the English as soon as the latter became formidable to them. That several of the Nations to the South and West greatly alarmed at the Power and increase of the English and irritated at the ill treatment they had met with had expressed a desire to meet the rest to deliberate on what was to be done. That the Spaniards & French had for a long time urged them to take up arms and given them repeated assurances of a powerful assistance. That they had now called them to a meeting at the Mississippi near the mouth of the Ohio for that purpose. That they had sent many Belts among the Indians, a great part of whom were just ready to set out when Sir Williams message came to them, and that they waited the event of the Treaty at Fort Stanwix before they would come to any further resolution with a variety of other particulars all tending to corroborate the former Intelligence received by Sir William Johnson. In the morning the Indians again met in Council, when the Warriors came and laid before their Sachems the result of their deliberations yesterday concerning the Northern part of the Line who directed four of their Sachems viz Tyaruruante, Ganaquieson, Tyeransera, and Tagawaron to wait on Sir William and communicate the same which was, that the Line should run from Oriscany to Tianderhah, and down that River to the Susquehanna, thence in a straight Line to the Hills, and so to the Delaware Branch & down the same to Oswego, thence down the Susquehanna to Shamokin, and so along the West Branch of that River to Kittanning declaring they would not part with any Lands to the Westward of Oriscany or down towards Wyoming or the Great Island, as they reserved that part of the Country for their Dependents.",0.031,0.086,0.883,0.9618,False,True,1768,10,24,1768,11,5

Nevertheless, he would do all he could to obtain a more favorable settlement. After which Sir William had many other private conferences which occupied a great part of the night — In particular Six Chiefs of the Oneidas came to him at nine o'clock at night and they very much doubted the validity of the purchase above Orisca — But through Sr Williams solicitations and to shew their good disposition towards completing the work in hand, they would agree that the Line should run from the Susquehanna North across at Fort Newport near Fort Stanwix where the Boats are launched, and from thence to the Northwest corner of the late purchase for Lord Holland & others.

The Oneidas returned to Sir Williams Quarters, and told him that their people positively refused to agree to any other Line than they had proposed the last night, & that as Game began to grow scarce in their neighbourhood, they had come to a Resolution to keep the carrying Place to the Canada Creek in their hands, as by keeping Horses and Carriages there as they proposed to do for the future to carry over the Traders Goods, they might earn somewhat for the support of their families. They thereupon withdrew to consult further upon it. They shortly after returned and said that Sir William had been so desirous to have the Bounds further extended the last and only thing they could say was, that provided they were allowed an equal use of the carrying Place with the English and to be paid Six Hundred Dollars to the Tribes over and besides the several Fees which were given in private, they should extend the Line to Canada Creek Sir William finding it best not to urge this matter farther told them that he acquiesced for the present leaving it to be confirmed or rejected by His Majesty They answered that they considered and unanimously resolved that whatever Boundary Line was now agreed to should be for ever binding & conclusive on both sides. That no province should on any pretence invade the Line and that whatever transaction might thereafter be necessary should be with the King or those by him directed to treat with them.

They accordingly came to Sir William's Quarters, when Sir William told them, he hoped they were now come with such an answer as would be pleasing to all Parties. The Map being then laid before them, they said, that what they had to say was the final resolves of all the Nations, then said at the same time, tracing it on the Map that they would agreeable to their just Claims begin the Line at the mouth of the Cherokee River, then go along to the South East side of the Ohio to Kittanning, from thence to the Head of the West Branch of Susquehanna thence down the same to Bald Eagle Creek thence across the River at Tiadaghta Creek below the great Island, thence by a straight Line to Burnett's Hills and along the same to the mouth of Awanda Creek on the West Side of the East Branch of Susquehanna, thence up the stream thereof to Oswego, thence Eastward to the Delaware River, thence up the stream thereof till they come opposite to the mouth of Tianaderah Creek emptying into Susquehanna, thence up the West side of Tianaderrah to the head of its Westerly Branch, and from thence to the mouth of Canada Creek on Wood Creek. This they delivered as their final determinations subject to several conditions for the security of their possessions and engagements entered into, and for that part which would fall within the Pennsylvania Government, they insisted on having 10,000 Dollars. Sir William told them he would take the matter into consideration and would assemble them all tomorrow and after parting conferred with the Commissioners of Pennsylvania concerning the same who approved it, and agreed to the consideration on behalf of the Proprietors.",0.005,0.094,0.901,0.9779,False,True,1768,10,24,1768,11,5
9,1768.txt,Treaty of Fort Stanwix,1768-10-24,1768-11-05,Rome,NY,Native Speaker,,Native,,"Brother, We are hopeful that you will not take it amiss that we have delayed till now our public answer on the subject you recommended to us, This was a great and weighty matter requiring long deliberation, and should not be undertaken lightly — We have accordingly considered it, and are now come to give you our final resolutions thereon, to which we beg your attention. Brother, We remember that on our first Meeting with you, when you came with your ship we kindly received you, entertained you, entered into an alliance with you, though we were then great & numerous and your people inconsiderable and week and we know that we entered into a Covenant Chain with you and fastened your ship therewith, but being apprehensive the Bark would break and your ship be lost we made one of iron, and held it fast that it should not slip from us, but perceiving the former chain was liable to rust; We made a silver chain to guard against it Then, Brother, you arose, renewed that chain which began to look dull, and have for many years taken care of our affairs by the command of the Great King, & you by your labors have polished that chain so that it has looked bright and is become known to all Nations, for all which we shall ever regard you and we are thankful to you in that you have taken such care of these great affairs of which we are always mindful, and we do now on our parts renew and strengthen the Covenant Chain by which we will abide so long as you shall preserve it strong & bright on your part. A Belt. Brother, We are glad that you have opened the River and cleared the Roads as it is so necessary to us both. We were promised that when the war was over, we should have Trade in plenty, Goods cheap and honest men to deal with us and that we should have proper persons to manage all this. We hope that these promises will never be forgot but that they will be fully performed that we shall feel the benefits of an intercourse between us — that the Roads and waters may be free and open to us all to go to the Southward, or for our friends from thence with whom we are now at peace to visit us, that we may have proper persons in our Countries to manage affairs and smiths to mend our arms and implements — and in the expectation of this, we do, now on our parts open the Roads and waters, and promise to assist in keeping them so. A Belt. Then after repeating all that had been said concerning the Line proceeded. Brother, We have long considered this proposal for a Boundary between us, and we think it will be of good consequence if you on your parts pay due regard to it, and we in consequence thereof have had sundry Meetings amongst ourselves and with you and from all that you have said to us thereon, we have at length come to a final resolution concerning it, and we hope that what is now agreed upon shall be inviolably observed on your parts as we are determined it shall be on ours and that no further attempts shall be made on our Lands but that this Line, be considered as final and we do now agree to the Line we have marked upon your Map, now before you on certain conditions on which we have spoken and shall say more and we desire that one Article of this our agreement be, that none of the Provinces or their People shall attempt to invade it under color of any old Deeds, or other pretences what soever for in many of these things we have been imposed on, and therefore we disclaim them all, which Bounds now agreed to we begin on the Ohio at the mouth of the Cherokee River [1] which is now our just right, and from thence we give up on the South side of Ohio to Kittanning above Fort Pitt, from thence a direct Line to the nearest Fork of the West Branch of Susquehanna thence through the Allegany Mountains along the south side of the said West Branch till we come opposite to the mouth of the Creek called Tiadaghton thence across the Nest Branch & along the East side of that Creek and along the ridge of Burnets Hills to a Creek called Awandae thence down the same to the East Branch of the Susquehanna, and across the same and up the East side of that River to Oswego, from thence Eastward to Delaware River, and up that River to opposite where Trinaderha falls into Susquehanna, thence to Trienaderha and up the West side thereof and its West Branches to the Head thereof thence by a straight Line to the mouth of Canada Creek where it empties itself into Wood Creek at the end of the long carrying place beyond Fort Stanwix, and this we declare to be our final Resolves and we expect that the conditions of this our Grant will be observed A Belt. Brother, Now as we have made so large a Cession to the King of such a valuable and Extensive Country, We do expect it as the Terms of our Agreement that strict regard be paid to all our reasonable desires — We do now on this on behalf and in the name of all our Warriors of every Nation, condition that all our Warriors shall have the liberty of hunting throughout the Country as they have no other means of subsistence and as your people have not the same occasions or inclinations. That the White people be restricted from hunting on our side of the Line to prevent contentions between us. A Belt. Brother, By this Belt we address ourselves to the Great King of England through You our superintendent in the Name and in behalf of all the Six Nations Shawanese, Delawares and all other our Friends, Allies, & Dependents, We now tell the King that we have given to him a great and valuable Country, and we know that what we shall now get for it must be far short of its value. We make it a condition of this our Agreement concerning the Line that His Majesty will not forget or neglect to show us His favor or suffer the Chain to contract Rust, but that he will direct those who have the management of our affairs to be punctual in renewing our ancient agreements. That as the Mohawks are now within the Line which we give to the King, and that these people are the true old heads of the whole confederacy their several villages and all the Land they occupy unpainted, about them as also the Residences of any others in our confederacy affected by this Cession shall be considered as their sole property and at their disposal both now, and so long as the sun shines, and that all grants or engagements they have now or lately entered into, shall be considered as independent of this Boundary so that they who have so little left may not lose the benefit of the sale of it, but that the people, with whom they have agreed, may have the Land. We likewise further condition on behalf of all the Six Nations and of all our allies, friends & Nephews our Dependents that as we have experienced how difficult it is to get justice or to make our complaints known and that it is not in the power of our Superintendent to take care of our affairs in different Places without the Kings help that His Majesty will give him help & strength to do us justice and to manage our affairs in a proper manner. We all know the want of this, and we make it a point of great consequence on which this our present Agreement is to depend and without which Affairs will go wrong and our heads may be turned. Brother, We likewise desire that as we have now given up a great deal of Lands within the Bounds that Mr Penn claimed a right of buying that he may in consequence of the agreement now entered into between us, enjoy what we have given within the Limits. And as we know that Lydius of Albany did in the name of several persons lay claim to Lands in Pennsylvania, which we know to be unjust, and that the Deeds he pretends a right to were invalid, We expect that no regard will be paid to them or any such claims now or hereafter, as we have fairly sold them to the proprietors of Pennsylvania to whom alone we shall sell Lands within that Province, and we shall now give them a Deed for that & other Lands there. And in order to show that we love justice, we expect the Traders who suffered by some of our dependents in the wars five years ago, may have a grant for the Lands we now give them down Ohio, as a satisfaction for their losses, and as our friend Mr [George] Croghan long ago got a Deed for Lands from us, which may now be taken into the Pennsylvania Lands, should it so happen, we request that it may be considered and get as much from the King somewhere else, as he fairly bought it. And as we have given enough to show our Love for the King and make his people easy, in the next place we expect that no old claims which we disavow or new encroachments may be allowed of. Brother, We have now gone through this matter and we have shown ourselves ready to give the King whatever we could reasonably spare. We on our parts express our regard for him and we hope for His favor in return. Our words are strong and our resolutions firm & we expect that our request will be complied with in so much as we have so generously complied with all that has been desired as far as was consistent with our Existence A Belt.",0.041,0.156,0.803,0.9997,False,True,1768,10,24,1768,11,5

Brother, We thank you for what you have said & we are hopeful that you will observe your engagements as we mean to do on our parts; but as this will in a great measure depend upon the Colonies, We now desire their Representatives here present to do every thing for preserving those engagements and keeping their people in good order.

We acknowledge that several of our Nations now present were witnesses to the transaction at Easton & therefore acquit that Province of any demand and we have only to desire of him to follow your example in his future Conduct towards us, which will sufficiently recommend him and his people to our esteem.

Notwithstanding we had the best thoughts in our minds  during the before mentioned period, nevertheless mischief has happened between you and us. We are however still anxious of putting our laudable  plan of accommodation into Execution, and we shall now inform you of the  matter, which we devised and considered of, as tending to make a peace,  which is, that we intended, whenever we the Indians entered into any negotiations with you, we should be all of one mind and one voice in our  speeches, with the whole of our confederacy of the different languages which  the Great Spirit planted on this ground we meant to finish them in a general  manner.   For we understood that your meaning was, that whenever we should have  a Council that some landed matters were to be transacted at it a matter of  the greatest importance to us, is that respecting our territories or giving  away lands when a division of territory is agreed to by some particular  nations without the concurrence of the whole of our confederacy, we look  upon it as illegal and of no effect, for it is a general concern, and unless it is  transacted with the unanimous consent of the whole, it can never stand  good.   Brothers, we think it is owing to yourselves that the peace between us has  not lasted, and that that essential good has been blended with confusion,  because that you did everything respecting it your own way, you made your  Council fires where you thought proper. Our plan was not followed which  was to speak to you in a general manner and with the voices of all the  Different nations of our Confederacy.   If this had taken place, we are almost certain that you and we, would now  have been on the most amicable footing.   We did everything in our power at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix to pursue  this plan, as our real intentions were at that very time to promote peace and  concord between us, and that we might look upon each other as friends, and  we gave you no cause or provocation to be otherwise.   Brothers, We are still of opinion to pursue those just steps of promoting  tranquility and happiness between us, notwithstanding the mischief that happened we wish you would take it into consideration and let us speak to  you in the manner we proposed.   Let us have a treaty with you early in the spring, let us pursue reasonable  steps, let us meet half way for our mutual convenience. We shall then bury  in oblivion the mischief that has happened, and speak to each other in the  style of friendship.   Brothers, We say let us meet half way and pursue such steps as become  upright and honest men, until which time we beg that you will prevent your  Surveyors and other people from coming on our side of the Ohio River ; we  have told you before we wish you to pursue just steps, and we are determined  that they shall appear just and reasonable in the eyes of the World. This is  the determination of all our Chiefs of our Confederacy now assembled here,  notwithstanding the accidents that have happened in our Villages and when  in Council, where several innocent Chiefs were killed when absolutely engaged in promoting a peace with you the thirteen United States. Although  then interrupted, the Chiefs here present still wish to meet you in the Spring  for the before mentioned good purpose, when we hope to speak to each other  in a style unaccompanied by haughtiness or menaces.   Brothers, We again request of you in the most earnest manner that you  will order your Surveyors and others that march on lands to cease from  crossing the Ohio, until we shall have spoke to you because the mischief  that has recently happened has always originated in that quarter, we shall  likewise preserve our people from going over until that time.   Brothers, It will be owing to your arrogance if this laudable plan, which we  so earnestly wish for, is not carried into execution, in that case the result  will be very precarious and if fresh ruptures ensue, we are confident we shall  be able to exculpate ourselves & most assuredly with our united force be  obliged to defend those immunities which the Great Spirit has been pleased  to give us, and if we should then be reduced to misfortune, the world will  pity us, when they think of the amicable proposals we made to prevent the  effusion of unnecessary blood.

After having reminded you of your promises and done your will I must inform you, that we and the other nations were much surprized to see people return from you to our Village unprovided, owing to the want of where with to supply them, as you told them you had not the things which they wanted. I beg of you Father not to use the same discourse to us, that you want certain things, but that you will provide not only for those who have accompanied me hither, but for those also who we have left behind to guard our village. 
Father! I, and my people expect that you will give us necessaries in abundance, as also, such ornaments which is acceptable and pleasing to young men, if otherwise we shall imagine, you do not speak from the Heart. 
 Father! You cannot be ignorant that we are always engaged with an Enemy, or, on the watch at our Villages. Father! You may recollect that the last time I was here, I lost a Prisoner, which you promised to see returned as he was adopted among us, I am there fore surprised that you have not yet satisfied me on that subject, as it does not correspond with your promise, I find by experience from my knowledge of mankind that from the late alteration you only speak from the mouth.  

        Father! I pray of you to consider that my loss is great with respect to the prisoner. If ever you have been in my situation judge from your feelings if I have not reason to regret his loss. Father! Before I finish my discourse I must repeat to you again to us our Warriours well, in supplying them with such things as they require. If not, what effect will my advice have upon them to enforce what you may direct?Father! You ordered two Barrels of Powder to be given out to us at St. Dooskey of which we have received but a small part. we therefore hope that you will order it to be delivered to us at present exclusive of our proportion which we are to have. 
Major De Peyster then answered: 
        Children of the Six Nations who Inhabit the Shawnee Country. Listen to the answer which I shall make to your speech When the Governor of this Place first engaged you to take the part of your English Father. He looked upon it as best for your mutual interest, on my arrival here I saw the necessity of your continuing to act on the side you were engaged, with out which you must have been overpowered before now you cannot deny but that I have ever fulfilled his promises as far as circumstances would admit. You that have so great a knowledge of humankind must also be capable to make allowances for accidents the ship which was loaded with the Goods for Indian presents was taken at sea and as often retaken by us, she at length arrived at Quebec but it was so late in the year, that the goods could not get up the country in time they are arrived at Niagara and I look for them every day. As soon as I get them you may expect to receive a proportion of such articles as the Commander in Chief has thought proper to send for his Indian Children but should you grow impatient before the things reach me and wish to go home, you must be content with such things only as I have to give you with respect to the two Barrels of Gun Powder which you desire to have over and above. I must observe to you that I do not mean the Powder as a reward for your services but to enable you to defend your selves against the Enemy and to hunt. The time which that Powder should have been expended is past, since which I have repeatedly sent powder in great quantities and make no doubt but that you have received your share thereof.

        Children ! Consider that we are to act for our mutual interest, if you push me beyond my abilities we shall both fall. if you find yourselves disappointed in not receiving your necessaries immediately depend upon it I am more so, particularly so, from the recommendation Captain Caldwell has given me of your conduct in the last Campaigne.  

        Children! With regard to the message which I forwarded to you, desiring you to treat all Prisoners with humanity, you must recollect that it's a language I have upon all occasions held out to you, and let me repeat that it is greatly your Interest to do so. If Captain Pipe had not put that Colonel to death after he had made him Prisoner, the Enemy would not have made an attack upon the Indian Country this year, for from every Intelligence which I receive they intimate it was only to revenge his Death. 

        Children! I have another Message from the Commander in Chief to you which is that you will not push the War into the Enemies Country but defend your own, in which he is ready to give you every assistance in his power. 

        Children! You tell me that I only speak from my mouth and not from the heart as I did not return the adopted Prisoner agreeable to promise believe me Children that I speak so much from the heart that I remember well what I said to you, which was if I could find the Prisoner that I should return him to you. I repeat the same to you still and I have so much feeling that I shall provide for the person to whom he was related. I have nothing more to say, but to desire Mr. Baby to treat you as well as he can at present with such things as is in store ",0.096,0.152,0.751,0.9966,False,True,1793,12,1,1793,12,1

A Message to the Half King 
	The Chiefs of the Council having received your message accompanying an Invitation from the Americans to attend a Treaty to be held by them are of opinion that you have not well considered the purport of it, otherwise you would not have delivered yourself so hastily or rashly, therefore they return it to you, desiring you may consider it wisely; recollecting at the same time that your directions from this Council when detached to that side of the Lake, were to receive Speeches or Messages, and not to determine upon them, but to rise up and lay them before this Council yourself to be settled here, and that they now expect your conduct upon this occasion will be such as to meet the approbation of all Parties. 
Brethren, as we could not be prepared to meet the Americans agreeable to their Invitation to us, we have sent them our answer, which will be communicated to you, in the meantime we are sorry to observe the pernicious conduct of some foolish men amongst you, who contrary to our advice, and that of our father, continue to carry on depredations tending to destroy the Quiet of the Country, as well as the good works the General Councils of our Confederacy are labouring to accomplish. We earnestly therefore desire the wise men amongst you, may exert themselves to restrain such headstrong men as persist in following their own Inclinations, as their bad behaviour must in the end operate as much against themselves as those they are endeavouring to injure. We fill your pipes with tobacco, wishing you to consider well in your present situation, and trust that you will be able to keep all your people quiet, till the result of our General Councils is known.

The Cornstalk said to his Father at Michilimakinac, that he would look up the Road and hinder the Americans to take possession of their Lands. 

His father told them that was right, & not to let any pass, except the English and French Traders.

Now the Americans are advancing, and assembling at the entrance 
of the Whole Rivers in great numbers; we received this intelligence by two Kickapoo messengers who arrived yesterday; they say the Americans are to come by three different Roads, first Vincennes, Eel River & Miamis; its one Mr. Le Gras wrote to the Kickapoos and told them the Americans were coming according to their promise.

Their Father at Michilimackinac told them, take care of your Traders and protect them.

This day I acquaint you, that they are advancing near to us, we expect you'll assist us, as likewise expect you will inform our Father at Michilimackinac, of his former promise to us, we expect a favorable answer from you, which will assist to cover us from the menaces of our Enemy.

It is not the first time we stop'd them from coming that Road, as the same with all the Force we have if they come that way again. We inform you of the contents of this Message and salute you.

The Wyandot, Ottawa, Chippewa, Potawatomi & their Confederates.

        Brethren, You sent speeches amongst us last year to Invite us who are of one colour to the Council Fire you kindled at Fort Stanwix to the Peace and other good things you said you had to offer us. Soon afterwards you kindled another Council fire at Beaver Creek to which you also Invited us, but you ought to know this is not the way to make a good or lasting Peace to take our Chiefs Prisoners and come with Soldiers at your Backs can never tend to general good between us.

        You now again Invite us to another Council Fire at the month of the Great Miamis, Your Messengers have gone through several nations but we are aware of your design to divide our councils, we are unanimous, and it is not right that you kindle fires among Brush or Nettles, Therefore we inform you that at Detroit is the Ancient Council Fire of our forefathers, there is the proper place, and when we see you there we will take you by the Hand, which cannot be sooner than next Spring, as we must have time to hear from the other Nations to the Westward, nothing can be done by us, but by General consent, we act and speak like one man.

Last Fall our Brethren the Americans call'd us to the Big Miamis: when we arrived there they said they had something to communicate of importance to our future welfare, and the happiness of our children after us. But alas we heard nothing good from them, they told us that our father had given us to them with our Lands. Their Commissioners assured us that every thing in the articles we now send to you, was agreeable to our best wishes and more generous than we had a right to expect from them, this induced us to sign their proposals, but we find that we have been ignorant of the real purport of them till our return here, our Hostages however that were detained by them are come home safe, we inform you how they have deceived us, by telling us the King of Great Britain had ceded the whole country to them, and we were not sensible of the error we have committed till our friend Elliot explained it to us.

	Father, we request you to be strong and give us the best advice you are capable of in our present situation, you see we have never been in more need of your friendship and good offices, we have been cheated by the Americans who are striving to work our destruction and without your assistance may be able to accomplish their ends, you have too much wisdom not to be convinced of this truth as well as us, we earnestly beg you will consider and send us a speedy answer.

Brothers & Nephews! We shall now acquaint you with our motives for taking an early and active part in the war; at first it was hard for us to determine which side to join with, as they were the same People fighting against each other, but upon mature and deliberate consideration, we thought it incumbent upon us to join the King our Father, for had we pretended to be neutral, we should have been divided amongst ourselves, for our young men would have acted on some side or other, by which we might have fought against each other, and ruin ourselves. Actuated as we were by our feelings and reasonings we could not but adhere to our former engagements of Fidelity to the King of Great Britain, we therefore resolved to take that side, and urged you also to do so, although the force of the Americans appeared to be more powerful than that of the King, yet it did ;not deter us from following the dictates of our Principles, nor were we at the time Peace was announced to us, either tired of the war, or even afraid, for our Preparations for war were as much in readiness last winter as ever.Brothers & Nephews! We shall now inform you of the Transactions of Councils held at Niagara by Brigadier General Sir John Johnson, this Summer with us. He informed us that the Peace was brought about, and desired us for to remain quiet and cease Hostilities. We accordingly agreed to lay our Hatchets aside & looked with a watchful eye towards our Lands, for the boundary Line which was agreed to fifteen years ago. And Sir John Johnson assured us that the boundary Line lately agreed to, did not deprive us of our Lands. The war not being of our own making, we readily agreed to what Sir John had recommended to us, altho' we the Six Nations are never hasty in our resolves when matters of war are concerned, and altho' we have laid the Hatchet aside, should they give us just cause to use it, we shall nevertheless be able to take it up in defence of our Bights. We mean to take care that we give no cause of rupture on our parts Brothers & Nephews, we desire you to pay attention to this, and do the same thing that we have resolved to, and do nothing in a hasty manner, let everything go through its proper channel that we may be of one mind and act alike.Brothers and Nephews attend.

where they had provided a place for us to live ; that they had also sent 
a speech to those of our nation who live near the Minnesinks, inviting

We are entirely satisfied upon this  account, and banish everything which could give us uneasiness from our  hearts, as you desire us, and we likewise request that you will do the same,  that nothing may remain upon either side to discontent us. (A string.)   

        Brethren : We have too great a regard for the ancient friendship  established between you and us, and which has so long subsisted between  our forefathers, to suffer the conduct of foolish men to have any bad effect  upon it, or to weaken our good intentions in the least, so as to loosen our  hands from the hold we have of it ; therefore we do not look towards the  evil that has been done, with any resentment in our minds, but with a desire to have it buried in oblivion, as well as everything else which has an  appearance of disturbing our future tranquillity. Be strong, brethren, and  think favorably of our peace, as we do, and we shall be too powerful for any bad people, who are not inclined to listen to or preserve it as we do.  

        Brethren, when our wise people concluded the peace which subsists between  us, it was mutually agreed between them, that though probably we might  lose people on both sides by the rashness or folly of bad men, that it ought  not, nor should not, have any evil effect upon the amity settled by them, and  this is still what we adhere to. 

        Brethren, last of all, spoke to our grandchildren, the Shawanese, upon this head, and desired them to keep their  young, imprudent men from doing mischief, and this advice we have again  given them at this time. (A belt.)   

        Brethren: The road which you have cleared between you and us,  we now, by this string of wampum, upon our parts, remove every obstacle  that may impede our traveling it with satisfaction, and we desire that our  young men may be permitted to continue their trade as usual. Those white  people who are in our towns, to the number of eleven, you will see in a few  days, who are going to Pittsburgh under the protection of your brethren, the  Delawares, and as soon as matters wear a more favorable aspect, we shall  expect them to return to our town.

We shall inform all  the Nations in friendship with us of what has passed between us at this  time, and in one month I’ll be able to complete this design, and then we  shall be able to distinguish those who are inclined to listen to our wise  people, and preserve the peace, from those that choose to speak by their  warriors. This will afford time for those who are inclined to remove  themselves to their Chiefs, and give an opportunity to the warriors to  speak to one another.

We acquainted you that our sincere desire was that the peace between us and our brethren the English, should be upon a lasting footing. We now are convinced that it will be upon a sure and permanent foundation, as our children may have an opportunity of being instructed in the Christian religion. We shall acquaint all the tribes of Indians of what has here passed between us, and we are satisfied that it will be very satisfactory to them to hear the good talk from our elder brother. For my part, I can assure you, brother, that for my tribe I can answer, even for the foolish young people thereof, that they will not be the cause of any disturbance in any manner whatever hereafter, either by theft or otherwise, or give cause of any trouble to your people.

But listen to what I shall say to them (laying down the Strings & Belts). Black & White Strings. Elder Brethren of the 6 Nations, You spoke to us yesterday, and what you said, we liked very well, But you did not speak to the real purpose you come upon to this Council Fire. You know very well you desired us to brighten the chain of Friendship with all the Southern and Western Nations. We have done it, and thought it was proper to acquaint our Elder Brethren the 6 nations therewith, which we did last year together with the Delaware?, Wyandotts and other Nations at your villages.We consulted with you also as our Elder Brethren what was best to be done for the safety of our Country and the good of our women and children. But you told us you could not tell us any thing; that our Chiefs and Warriors were invited to an American Treaty. We then told you were on our way to Quebec, to see our Father. When we had finished our business with our Father we returned and stayed six days at the six Nation Village, and you said nothing to us. Now Brothers, of the 6 Nations what you said to us yesterday, was nothing to the purpose for which you were sent to this Council Fire. The Road which our Fore Fathers made to your Country, is plain and wide. I can see very well what you are about from this place. Brothers of the 6 Nations, You are still talking to the Americans, Your head is still towards them and you are now talking to them. When you left your Villages to come here, You had a bundle of American Speeches under your Arm. I now desire you Brothers to lay that Bundle down here and explain what you have been talking with them these last two years. When we hear all you have to say, or if it is right and good we will lay all our heads together, for the welfare of our Country, our Women and our Warriors. Brothers of the 6 Nations, All the different nations here, now desire you to speak from your Heart, and not from your mouth, and tell them what that Bundle was which you had under your arm when you came here, — We know what you are about, we see you plainly. He then threw down at the Seneca's feet the strings on which he had spoke. Brothers of the 6 Nations, I desire you will listen attentively to what I am now going to say to you. Yesterday you asked for a private Council as you told us we did not understand some things which you had said to us. We now very well understand all you have said and return you our thanks. You desired us to consider well what we should deter mine on for the good of our women, our children and our warriors. I now tell you Brothers we have considered well and now I am going to tell you, the minds of all your Brethren in this Country. Brothers of the 6 Nations, You have told us you have been listening these last two years to the United States and that during that time, you heard nothing, but what tended to the welfare of the people of our Colour. How can this be? For whilst you were considering for the good of your Western Brethren, two powerful armies were sent by the Amerioans to destroy us. Has their sweet speeches so much intoxioated you and blinded you, that your sight oould not reach so far, as where we are now sitting? Brothers of the 6 Nations, Had the Great Spirit been favorable to them instead of us, you would have found here, their strong forts, and only a small remnant or perhaps none of your Western' Brethren to deliver their sweet speeches to. But Brothers, they took the same step with your nephews the Delawares and your Brothers the Hurons, whom you see here, which they did with you, to induce them to sit quiet whilst they were destroying us, but they did not succeed so well with these Nations as with our elder Brethren, for you now see them strong in defending their just right to this Country, they put their speeches behind them, and united themselves to us as one man. Now Brothers of the 6 Nations, This is the way they served you, and you have listened to them. • We know they want to break you off from the Nations here. But the great Spirit has now put it in your hearts, not to be broken off by them from the general Indian Confederacy. Since therefore you have now told us you have spoken from your Hearts, and that nothing remains further for you to say on the subject of your busi ness. We hope it is the truth and that nothing will now come from you, but what may tend to our general welfare and happiness. Brothers of the 6 Nations, (4 Black & White Strings). You desired us to listen to you candidly and consider well what we were going to do. We have now considered what is best for us to do, I therefore desire you, to listen to me and I will tell you the resolution of all the nations, to the Southward and as far as the setting of the Sun, deputies of whose nations are now present. Brothers, We know very well what the Americans are about, and what are their designs. Last Fall, when the great Spirit was good enough to assist us, to throw them on their backs, we got their great Chiefs Papers and Instructions, B, at that Point of Land there which you now see, all the chiefs here present heard them interpreted to us. If the Americans had been successful, they were to build a strong Fort at the Miamis Towns, they were then to come here and build another, and then if they succeeded, they were to proceed to the mouth of this River and build another strong Fort there. They were afterwards to have set about building Boats and to drive all the Indians entirely out of the Country, to clear the Lake of them, and drive them far back into the Country. But if any of the Nations came and offered their hands, the American Chief was to put them at his back and give them Hce's in their Hands to plant Corn for him and his people, and make them labour, like beasts, their Oxen and their Pack Horses. Brothers of the 6 Nations, We now tell you, we know very well the Intentions of the Americans. You have desired us to consider well what you have said to us, and not to be too proud spirited. We are not proud spirited, nor do we attribute our great good fortune these last few years, to our own strength alone, but to the great Spirit who governs all things on this earth and who looks down on us with as much, or perhaps more, compassion than those of a fairer complexion. Brother, You know very well the boundary that was made between us, and the English and Americans when they were as one people. It was the River Ohio. — Now Brothers of the 6 Nations, as you were sent here by the Americans to tell us what they say. We now tell you Brothers to go the same road you came and inform them, that the boundary line then fixed on is what we want and that is the determination of all the nations present yours as well as ours. Brothers, You have told us that Washington says he will make us a compensation, if the Lands were not purchased of the right owners. We do not want compensation; We want a restitution of our Lands which He holds under false pretenses. Brothers you want to go the Roads towards the American Forts. That Road Brothers is all bloody by the Americans forgoing themselves into our Country; We therefore desire you to go the Road you came, the road which our Forefathers came. Brothers, The cause of the American Messengers falling to the ground was owing to their following this bloody path, where numerous Bands of distant Tribes are constantly watching any movements into our Country: Had they however arrived safe, they should have been returned safe from this Council Fire. You tell us Brothers, that Washington also says he can easily remove these Forts, if they give us uneasiness. Now Brothers, If the Americans want to make peace with us, Let them destroy these Forts and we will meet them next spring at Lower Sandusky, where all the parties who formerly settled the Boundary Line, must be present. Four Strings Black & White Wampum. Brothers of the 6 Nations, This is what we desire you to tell the Americans and I tell it to you as the Sentiments of all the Indian Nations in this Country. Elder Brethren of the 6 Nations, We have now only to explain to you every thing fully with regard to the proposed Council at Lower Sandusky early in the Spring, & I desire you to listen attentively to what I am going to say to you. Brothers, When the Boundary Line was made at Fort Stanwix, our Father the King of England and the Americans were as one. Our Father must have that Treaty, and we will ask him to produce it, to vindicate our claims. He must be present also at the Council, for we know nothing of writing, and his assistance will be indispensably necessary for us, as well as all the parties who were formerly at the settling of the Boundary Line. We have a reliance on our father seeing Justice done to us; He never deceives us, and we have always found we may confidently depend upon him. Brothers, On the present occasion it is fortunate for us, that the Great King our Father has sent a person vested with his authority to take care of all his children in this Country. It is him we mean to take by the Hand and lead to the intended Council at Sandusky, should Washington accept our proposals, and manifest that Justice and humanity he talks so much about and pretends towards us. And we hope our Father will assist us also with provisions to enable us to meet at the place appointed. Brothers, Our Father Wapemassawa, has come to visit our new settlement here and to distribute the clothing for our old people & children usually sent them at this season of the year by order of the King our Great Father; We will therefore take this opportunity to explain to him the determination of this Council for the information of our Father the Governor at Niagara, and to request his presence and assistance at the intended Council at Lower Sandusky.

Taking a black & white string. Brothers, We have now come to Council with you, as you sent for us, and I beg you will listen attentively, as you desired us to tell you what we had in our minds. We are now following the steps of our Forefathers, and renewing our ancient Friendship. Listen therefore to what we have now to say to you. Then taking the Bundle of Speeches and Belts, that were given to them the last Council day, thus proceeded. Brothers, We are very glad you have strengthened the Chain of Friendship with all the distant Nations from whom you received these Belts & Speeches. It was always our advice to you to do so, and we are glad you have followed it, and we return you our thanks for the pains you have taken to accomplish it. Brothers, You told us also of the Creek and Cherokee Nations being now present, we return you thanks for that also, as it will brighten the chain of friendship with all Nations. A Pipe. Brothers, We thank you for shewing us this Pipe of Peace & Friendship, which was sent, to be left here for all nations of our Colour, to take hold of. We now join our hands to it, and leave it to be lodged with you, for the purpose you have mentioned. Black and White Strings. Brothers, I now speak to the Counsellors & Warriors and I desire you will take notice what I shall say to you. The white people are looking at us, & know what we are about, — They are always the Instigators of our Quarrels; let us now unite and consider what will be the best for us, our women and children, to lengthen our days and be in peace. Several Strings of White Wampum. Brothers, I address myself to all the Nations. You know that 4 years ago we met in Council at the Foot of the Rapids, you will remember all that passed there. You invited us now to come here, as we had not seen you for four years and you suppose we were doing something all that time for your good. I now tell you we have been endeavouring to do something for your good, the last two years in our Council. Brothers, When the White People on the Island were as one man, They asked us at Fort Stanwix for Land; we granted it. A few years afterwards, they fell out among themselves. The King our Father, told us he was going to chastise his son and no body else, and it would be over in a short time — soon after we were desired by the People of this Island to sit still and not mind the Quarrels of Father & Son, But shortly after that, Our Father the King, desired us to take part with him, which we complied with. Our Father was defeated by the Americans and then made a peace and left us alone — Our Father then desired us to speak to the Americans for as good a peace as we could get for ourselves. We have been trying to do so in the best manner we could, and we now desire you to do the same and to join with us in our best endeavours for that purpose. The Country you live in is a very good one and I like it very much. Brothers, You were fortunate that the Great Spirit above was so kind as to assist you to throw the Americans twice on their backs when they came against your Villages, Women and Children. Now Brothers, we know that the Americans have held out their hands to offer you peace. Don't be too proud spirited and reject it, lest the Great Spirit should be angry with you, but let us go on in the best manner we can to make peace with them. A Black & White String. Now Counsellors and Warriors, You have heard what I had to say, I hope you will attend to it. Your warriors were lately in the front, but L hope to see the Counsellors there, & they consulting together which is the best means of making peace for the advantage of ourselves, our Women & Children. A Black & White Belt. Brothers, You have heard what the 6 Nations have said to you. You will remember the Americans have come when we have been in Council and kicked out our Fire. We now kindle it once more that we may settle what is good and proper for peace, for our Women Children and Warriors. A Chief of the Seven Nations of Canada, With a White String.

A large white Belt. Brothers, Listen to what I am going to say to your Counsellors. When you desired us to come to this Council Fire, you sent us word to come at our warriors backs. If any thing goes wrong it will be the fault of the Counsellors & not of the Warriors. The Sachems and Chiefs of the 7 Nations, desire that all the nations of our Colour in this Island should be of one mind and strong. Our Father the King, has always desired us to be of one mind, to have but one Heart and to unite ourselves firmly together for our general interests and safety. The Americans want to take our Country from us. The 7 nations have never once spoken to them since our Father made peace. Now Brothers, as the Americans are now wanting to speak to us, let us put our Heads together and join as one nation, and if they do not agree to what we shall determine on: Let us all strike them at once. These are the sentiments of the 7 Nations. He then delivered separate Belts from each of the 7 Nations, with a short speech to each expressing the nation to whom the Belt belonged.

You very well know when you returned from Canada last year, you passed by our Villages & went by Tiendenagce's. Brothers, You tell us that we are always running to the Americans and telling them everything. We have been talking to them, tis true; They sent for us and led us by the hand to Philadelphia where we met the 13 States and Washington. He told us he had had several meetings with the Indians on 4his Island at Beaver Creek and several other places. You all know & the Wyandotts whom I see sitting there know. — What was said there — it cannot be strange to any of you. Brothers, Washington asked us what was the cause of the uneasiness of the Western Nations. We told him it was in regard to their Lands. He then told us he would satisfy the owners of the Land, if it had been sold by people who were not the real owners thereof; But he wishes for a Council with all the Nations, for that purpose. Brothers, He did not say he would give up the Lauds, but that be would satisfy the Indians for them. That he wanted nothing so much as the friendship of all his Brothers the Indians throughout this Island. He then desired us to come to you with his Speeches, & tell you all he said, & he added that if the Forts he had made in the Country gave uneasiness he would remove them. Brothers, He also told us, that after we had finished our business, it might be dangerous for us to return through the Country; But that you had many prisoners of his and that you could easily send some of them to tell him what had been determined on. Brothers, These are the papers and speeches, (taking up a Tin base) which we received ""B"" & we now give them to you. This is all we have to say, take them to your Father and he will explain them to you. Brothers, The 6 Nations return you thanks for what you have said to us.

Brothers, We have already mentioned to you, that we have been two years in Council with Washington and during that time, we have heard nothing fall from him, but what breathed the strongest desire of cultivating peace & friendship, with all nations of our Colour on this Island, on the ground of justice & humanity. For which pur pose he has desired us to speak to you our Western Brethren to know your sentiments, it behooves you therefore to consider well what answer is to be returned to him. Brothers, You remember- when our Father and the Americans quarreled, the Amerioans desired us Red People to sit still, as we had no business in their dispute. But our Father put the Hatchet into our Hands, to strike the Amerioans and we were both unsuccessful — from that moment our Lands were torn to pieces, and the Amer icans triumphed as the greatest people in this great Island.

 Father, I salute you and our Great Father beyond the Great Lakes in the name of your children , the Potewatemys. Father. I am instructed by your children to acquaint you that they were the first of all your Indian children who took up the Tomahawk against the Big Knives. They were amongst the first at Chicago, Detroit. River au Raisin, Defiance and Fort Meigs, even so far back as the Tepikono Battle, where several of them fell fighting under the Shawenese Prophet's Banner is well known to all the World. At the River au Raisin the Potewatemys composed the Right Wing of the Army under the command of General Procter and when of the Enemy under Genl. Winchester made an attempt to out flank our English Father. The Potewatemys rushed upon them and cut those 300 into pieces in consequence of which our English Father gained a signal victory for the remainder of the Enemy’s Army surrendered. It is true that some of the Potewatemyshave taken the Big Knives by the hand, but those people who have done so are men of no influence with the Warriors of our nation,those who have acted so improperly are the Five Medals followers, men of no principles nor bravery, to the Contrary, aset of cowardly fellows who have suffered themselves to be bought over to the Enemy's Interest for a little whiskey.
 
 Father. Your children the Potewatemys of St. Josephs were compelled to take refuge at or about St. Josephs River when it was abandoned by Genl Procter, since that time they have suffered great distress especially last winter and tho they were repeatedly invited by the 5 Medals to go with him to the Big Knives for ammunition, they preferred to suffer rather than treat with those bad people the Big Knives who are the authors of their misery. Father. This last Spring your children sent you paroles requesting you would extend your bounty to them, You was good enough to listen to them & sent Ammunition and some articles of clothing which your children received but Father your children are very numerous, consequently each man's proportion was small. 
 
 Father, Misawgawwe Shawanese and Mishpawkissh War Chiefs thank you in the name of all your children of our nation that remain true and faithful for the supplies you sent to them last Spring and they trust you will continue to relieve them conformable to the promise made them by our Great Father's representative at Detroit at the time your children showed their fidelity & attachment with their Brethren the Chippawas & Ottowas in taking up the Hatchet. 
 
 Father, Our Nation looks to this place for security, you are our Great Father's representative at this Great Fire, and you have been made acquainted with the deplorable situation of your children. They would have followed General Procter when he abandoned Detroit, but they were prevented by the Enemy who cut off their communication. Our powerful men & warriors implore your charitable hand & hope you will assist them with ammunition & clothing — Our women are almost naked and no Traders in that quarter for any article of clothing. St. Josephs & its dependencies will furnish 400 men who are true to you. 
 Father, You sent Paroles to the Kickapoos, and Potewatemys of the plains, to assemble at St. Josephs or near that place, but it cannot be done at present my Father. It is necessary that they should remain at my village near the bottom of the Tiakikee to attack the Big Knives, who understand mean to lay our Country waste and I want your children, the Kickapoos, to remain with us, in order to fight and maintain our independence, and let those evil spirits the Big Knives know that we hold our Lands sacred. Had you wanted your children the Kickapoos to assist you at Mackina I would have accompanied them at the risk of losing all that is dear to us, but as it is only an invitation for them to settle themselves at St. Joseph’s, It is my opinion they are better here, out of the Enemy's Emissaries. After this explanation I hope Father thatyou will not be displeased at my conduct.

Your children the Potewatemys of St Joseph’s were compelled to take refuge at or about St. Josephs River when they were abandoned by Genl Procter, since that time they have suffered great distress especially last winter and tho they were repeatedly invited by the 5 Medals to go with him to the Big Knives for ammunition, they preferred to suffer rather than treat with those bad people the Big Knives who are the authors of their misery. Father. This last Spring your children sent you paroles request ing you would extend your bounty to them, You was good enough to listen to them & sent Ammunition and some articles of clothing which your children received but Father your children are very numerous, consequently each man’s proportion was small. Father, Misawgawe Shaywaynesee and Miskinaysway War Chiefs thank you in the name of all your children of our nation that remain true and faithful for the supplies you sent to them last Spring and they trust you will continue to relieve them conformable to the promise made them by our Great Father’s representative at Detroit at the time your children showed their fidelity & attachment with their Brethren the Ohippawas & Ottawas in taking up the Hatchet. Father. Our Nation look to this place for succour, you are our Great Father’s representative at this Great Fire, and you have been made acquainted with the deplorable situation of your, children. They would have followed General Procter when he abandoned Detroit, but they were prevented by the Enemy who cut off their communication. Our powerful men & warriors implore your charitable hand & hope you will assist them with ammunition & clothing Our women are almost naked and no Traders in that quarter to afford any article of clothing. St. Josephs & its depens Michigan will furnish 400 men who are true to you. Speech delivered by the same Person on behalf of Neshkagenay main or Bad Sturgeon a Potewatemy. Father, You sent Paroles to the Kickapoos, and Potewatemy‘s of the plains, to assemble at St. Josephs or near that place, but it cannot be done at present my Father. Slfs into the necessary that they should remain at my village near ieagneB S qf bottom of the Tiakikee to attack the Big Knives, who ian Mlchl I understand mean to lay our Country waste and. 1 want your children the Kickapoos to remain with us, in order to fight and maintain our independence, and let those evil spirits the Big Knives' know that we hold our Lands sacred. Had you wanted your children the Kickapoos to assist you at Mackina 1 would have accompanied them at the risk of losing all that is dear to us, but as it is only an invitation for them to settle themselves at St. Joseph’s It is my opinion they are better here, out of reach of the Enemy’s Emissaries. After this explanation I hope Father you will not be displeased at my conduct. Father, I request that you will send me and my warriors some ammunition & clothing. Speech 'delivered by Mishpawkissh in behalf of Ohebainse a Pottewatemy Chief who fought the Enemy at this place the 4th of August last. Father T sent Paroles to the Miamis, Kickapoos, and Delawares to remove to St. Joseph’s agreeable to your desire, and I am now happy to have it in my power to inform you that those nations before mentioned have sent me by a special messenger word that they would remove to this place that the Big Knives were a perfidious nation, that they had repeatedly deceived them, and lately had invited them to a Council at Fort Grenville, holding forth that those who could attend the Treaty would all be clothed, in consequence of which several attended but finding that the Big Knives not inclined to comply with the promises held out by their Emissaries, The Miamis, Kickapoos, & Delawares went away from Grenville. Ruhardville the Pakan Chief of the Miamis & all his family is on his way to this place the rest are to follow.

The Governor of New Jersey and the Commanders of Virginia & Pennsylvania do likewise welcome you here. Lieutenant Governor Penn came hither to meet you & waited a considerable time, but was at length by business obliged to return home, leaving these Gentlemen as Commanders on behalf of Pennsylvania. Both the Governor & Gentlemen Commanders as well as myself, having waited here a month to no purpose began to be impatient never the less you see that their desire to meet you prevailed over every other consideration and induced them to stay. I hope therefore that you are now come fully prepared and with Hearts well inclined to the great business for which we are convened, and in order to prepare you the better for these purposes, I do now, agreeable to the ancient custom established by our Forefathers, proceed to the ceremony of Condolence usual on these occasions. And first: With this String of Wampum. I do, on behalf of His Majesty & all His subjects wipe away the Tears from your eyes which you are constantly shedding for your late deceased Chiefs, and I clear your sight that so you may look cheerfully at your Brethren, who are come from Several of the Provinces to attend this General Congress ordered by His Majesty to be held by me; in order to settle some necessary points between him & you. With this String I clear the Passage to your Hearts that you may speak cheerfully and candidly on the several subjects which, during this Congress, will be treated of, as well as to remove all sorrow & uneasiness from you. With this last string I wipe away the blood of your friends from off your Births, that you may on your return rest with Peace and comfort on them. Gave the 3 Strings. Brethren, I am greatly concerned for the many losses you have sustained in your several Nations since our last meeting & sincerely condole with you for them all. A Belt. Brethren, With this Belt, I light up anew your several Council Fires, that the Chiefs still remaining may upon all occasions sit comfortably by them and consult on the several matters, which may come before them.  A Belt. Brethren, As I have by the former Belt kindled up your several Council Fires, I do now by this Belt desire, that you the Councillors will duly assemble, when the affairs of your nations require it, & then jealously apply yourselves to every measure which may tend to your Peace and Interest. A Belt. Brethren, With this Belt I dispel the darkness which for some time past hath overspread your several Countries, by reason of your many & great Losses, and now heartily wish you may enjoy a serene clear sky, so that you may be able to see your Brethren from the Sun rising to the Sun setting. A Belt. Brethren, As I would deal with all people in their own way, and that your Ancestors have from the earliest time directed and recommended the observation of a Set of Rules which they laid down for you to follow, I do now, agreeable to that custom, take of the clearest water and therewith cleanse your inside from all Filth and every thing which has given you concern. A Belt. Brethren, I must desire that you Sachems & Councillors will, as occasions may require consult with the Cheiftains of your young men, as they are in general men of sense and experience; and you cheiftains and Warriors to pay a due regard to your Sachems and Councillors whose sage advice will seldom or never be amiss. A Belt. Brethren, In performing these ceremonies I can not omit this necessary part, which is, that as there are but two Council Fires for your confederacy, the one at my house and the other at Onondaga, I must desire that you will always be ready to attend either of them, when called upon, by which means business will I hope, always be attended & properly carried on for our mutual Interest, and this I earnestly recommend to you all. A Belt. Brethren, I must also advise you to be unanimous amongst yourselves & reside in your respective Countries, and not think of scattering or settling amongst other Nations, as has been too much the Practice for some years past, to the great weakening of your confederacy. A Belt. Brethren, I give you a Pouch with a String of Wampum in it, which you are to make use of when you hear of the loss of any of the Confederacy, and rise up on such occasions without delay in order to condole for the same, and remove the concern thereby occasioned. 3 Strings of Wampum.

Belt of the Covenant Chain: 15 Rows with human figures at each end. Brethren, I persuade myself that you are all sensible of the Benefits which result from our strict Union, & that having it always before your eyes, you will be careful in preserving it. This will protect you from all dangers, & secure to you the blessings of Peace, and the advantages of Commerce with a people able to supply all your wants.

A Large Belt. Brethren, Hearken to me who have good words to speak to you, such as are for the benefit of your whole confederacy and of your children yet unborn. You all remember that three years ago I signified to you His Majesty’s desire to establish a Boundary Line between his people and yours and that we then agreed together how some part of that Line should run, whenever, the same came to be settled. You all, I am hopeful, recollect the Reasons I then gave you for making such a Boundary never the less I shall again repeat them. You know Brethren that the encroachments upon your Lands have been always one of your principal subjects of complaint, and that so far as it could be done endeavors have not been wanting for your obtaining Redress. But it was a difficult Task, and generally unsuccessful for although the Provinces have bounds between each other, there are no certain Bounds between them & you, And thereby not only several of our people ignorant in Indian Affairs have advanced too far into your country, but also many of your own people through the want of such a Line have been deceived in the Sales they have made or in the limits they have set to our respective claims. This, Brethren, is a sad Case, which has frequently given us much trouble, and turned many of your heads; but it is likely to continue so until some Bounds are agreed to, fixed upon and made public between us. The Great the good King of England my master, whose friendship and tender regard for your Interests I wish you may ever hold in remembrance has amongst other Instances of his Goodness after long deliberation on some means for your relief, and for preventing future disputes concerning Lands, at length resolved upon fixing a general Boundary Line between his subjects and you, and that in such a manner as shall be most agreeable to you, in consequence of which I have received his Royal commands to call you together for the establishment thereof, and after conferring with the Governments interested hereupon, you now see before you the Governor of the Jerseys, the Commissioners on behalf of Aseregoa, Governor of Virginia & Commissioners from Pennsylvania in order to give you the strongest assurances on behalf of the respective Governments of their Resolutions to pay due regard to what shall be now entered into, the presence of so many great men will give a sanction to the transaction and cause the same to be known as far as the English Name extends — His Majesty has directed me to give you a handsome proof of his Generosity proportioned to the nature and extent of what Lands shall fall to him — Upon the whole I hope that your deliberations will be unanimous & your Resolutions such as His Majesty may consider as proofs of your gratitude for all his favors — A fine New Belt. The Importance of this affair now before us requires the most serious attention. I will not burthen you with any other subject until this is generally settled, and therefore we shall adjourn, that you may have time to think of it and come fully prepared to give an agreeable answer.",0.036,0.164,0.8,0.9987,False,True,1768,10,24,1768,11,5

All these things I had in consideration before, & I recommended the Line to you generally at first according to your own practice as an Introduction to the rest and in order to render the whole clear & plain to you, I have prepared a Map on which the Country is drawn large & plain which will enable us both to judge better of these matters. I would therefore recommend it to you to send the chiefs of each Nation to my Quarters where I shall lay the Map before them & confer with them upon it. Sir William laid a Map on the Table & after explaining to them the nature of his orders & the desires of Government he spoke as follows: Brothers, Here is the Map of which I spoke to you, where all that Country which is the subject of our meeting is faithfully laid down. The Line here described between the Kanhawa River & Oswego was what we spoke about — The King has not fixed upon any particular place to continue it to. It therefore remains for me to obtain a continuation of that Line which will be secure to you and advantageous to us on which subject we now meet — I have likewise to observe to you that the piece of Land in the Forks of Susquehanna is very much desired by the Commissioners from Pennsylvania and would be more advantageous to them than to you, besides as it is or will be soon partly surrounded by Settlements it will be a very difficult matter to get any people to go far to the Northward, & leave such Land as it were behind them — I would therefore propose, the Bounds from Fort Pitt be continued up to the Ohio to Moghulbughilum Creek, Thence up that Creek & along the eight mile Carrying Place to the West Branch of Susquehanna thence along that River to the Allegany Ridge. Thence along that Ridge of Mountains to the Cayuga Branch & down the same to the Great East Branch of Susquehanna, from thence up that East Branch to Oswegy, from whence it can be run Eastward to the Delaware River, which is very near it at that Place and for that part of this additional Cession which will fall to Mr Penn, you will receive a large & handsome consideration over and besides His Majesty Royal Bounty And as to the continuation of that Line from the Delaware so as to close it, I must desire to hear what yourselves think & I expect that your Resolutions will be advantageous to us, & that you will make proper allowance for the increase of our People whereby you will recommend yourselves to the King, and become so pleasing to his subjects that it will greatly contribute to the due observance of the Boundary Line.",0.008,0.099,0.893,0.9907,False,True,1768,10,24,1768,11,5

In the first place I acknowledge to have heard of your claim to the Southward before this time The King does not deny your claims He is not thoroughly acquainted with the exact extent of them and finding that they may be liable to some dispute with the Southern Indians, he being an enemy to strife directed the Line to be run in the manner he thought least liable to it. But of this I shall take further notice to you having no[w] to speak to you in answer to the course you have proposed for continuing the Line from Delaware. Brothers, I know very well how you are situated and it is not His Majesty’s inclination to disturb you therein, at the same time you should consider what is reasonable on your parts and that the Lands are even patented further than you propose the Line, and that the more people are confined the more readily will the transgress the bounds so that I must desire you to think the better of it and speak more favorably at our next meeting, till when I shall propose nothing further, as I could not consistently propose any other Line than such as would bring us to or near Lake Ontario. ... he was really become very impatient through the delays which was given to business, that the security of their Lands depended upon their dispatch and the freedom of the Cession — That he would however wait till Monday, when he hoped to hear from them some thing that might make up for their delays.

That these Gentlemen and all others concerned would have reason to blame him for agreeing to lines so injurious to their Rights, and that the continuance of a line from thence in the manner that they proposed would in many places approach so near to our settlements, as to render its duration very uncertain from the great increase of our people, whereas by giving them more room, the Boundary would be so well known, and secured by Laws before there would be occasion to invade it, that people would act with extreme caution and rather go to other unsettled parts than attempt to transgress an agreement so well defended — That it had been long in agitation and was now according to their own desires ordered by His Majesty to be settled, as the surest means of putting an end to Land Disputes, and that if they rejected this opportunity now offered them and drew the Line so as to interfere with Grants, or approach almost to our settlements, he could not see that any thing more effectual could thereafter be proposed for preventing encroachments, and the Crown after being already at a very heavy expense on this occasion must find its good intentions and reasonable proposals totally defeated. He therefore recommended it to them to consider this point farther, and as his Majesty’s Bounty, or that of the Colonies would be proportioned to the extent of their Cession, a rule which he should observe upon this occasion — That he hoped for a more favorable Answer as it would be more to their immediate advantage and would tend to the better observance of the Line hereafter. After these and many other arguments, & farther explaining the several courses laid down on the draft, they agreed to take the Map back to their Council Hut for farther consideration, promising to use their Interest with the rest for a more favorable Line then withdrew.

I gave you all the time necessary for bringing this weighty affair to a deliberate conclusion. Brothers, I am glad to find that you remember your old agreements so particularly and I wish you may always observe them, and with that view I should have been glad to have heard you confine your answer to my Belt for keeping the Roads open, to that subject alone, as a free and safe intercourse between us is so necessary to you. The promises formerly made you of the happy change which would be produced by the Reduction of Canada you have in many respects experienced as far as it was in the power of his Majesty’s Servants. You likewise have had a considerable number of Traders amongst you which has so far lowered the Prices of Goods that several of them are become Bankrupt and at many of the Posts, they are to be bought at as low rates as at our Towns, notwithstanding the distance and expence of Transportation. I am to inform you that it has been judged advisable by the Government to commit that part of business regarding the management of the Indian Trade to the care & charge of the several Colonies who I make no doubt will endeavour to do every thing they can for your interest. A Belt. You have of late made several complaints on account of the ill behaviour of some people on the Frontiers; those that regarded Pennsylvania, I have reason to think I finally settled and gave a handsome portion of their bounty upon the occasion, and in consequence of the information I gave the Governor of Virginia thereon, his Assembly passed several Votes in your favour, which are now before me, whilst the Governor sent this assurance of their good faith and friendship for you and of their intentions to prevent you from being ill treated. Here showed and explained the Resolves of the House of Burgesses likewise a paper under the Great Seal of the Province of Virginia authorizing Sir William to give to them those favorable assurances and proceeds. Brothers, I hope all this will convince you that they are your friends and as further proof of it the Gentlemen Commanders from those Provinces will at their return take proper measures for your future good treatment & for the due observance of the Boundary Line by proper Laws for these purposes, according his Matys desires which I shall recommend to their remembrance A belt. Brothers, I am glad the Boundary is at length agreed upon, & as I have great reason to think it will be duly observed by the English. I recommend it to you to preserve it carefully in remembrance to explain it fully to those that are absent and to teach it to your children. This Boundary is intended to be lasting but should it be found necessary by His Majesty or yourselves to make any future additions or alterations he will treat with you by those who have the management of your affairs. And never permit any private application this I have received in command to tell you. As to the several reservations you make in your Cession to the King and the other points you recommend, you may be assured that His Majesty shall be made acquainted with them, as I shall transmit to him a copy of our transactions at this place & I may venture to assure you that they will meet with all possible regard from a Prince of His clemency & Justice & I now give you this Belt to strengthen ratify and confirm the Boundary to all transactions necessary thereto. A Belt. Brothers, The speech which you addressed particularly to His Majesty shall be faithfully transmitted to him with the rest of your proceedings. I have attended to the whole of it & I persuade myself that every reasonable article will be taken proper notice of & that he will take such measures as to him shall seem best for your benefit and for the rendering you justice. I likewise consider your good intentions towards the Traders who sustained the losses & your desire to fulfill all your other engagements as instances of your integrity. I wish that you may on your parts carefully remember & faithfully observe the Engagements you have now as well as formerly entered into with the English, and that you may every day grow more sensible how much it is in your Interest to do so. And I once more exhort you all to be strong and steadfast to keep firm hold of the Covenant Chain & never to give attention or credit to People who under the Masque of friendship should come amongst you with stories which may tend to weaken your attachment to us, but to keep your eye steadfastly on those whose business & inclination it is to tell you truth & make your minds easy.

Brothers, the Shawanese & Delawares, I now particularly address you, in that you live far to the Southward, & may at some times be disturbed by bad men who, taking advantage of our distance from us & the Heads of the Confederacy, may by Belts, Messages, or Stories invented to create mischief impose on many of your people & through their means mislead other Nations. I am not ignorant that this has happened & I have good intelligence that there are people who have been lately deceiving some of you with stories of Revolutions in American affairs & of French Fleets & armies, with which you have been so often deceived that I wonder any of your people should credit them. Be assured, Brothers, that those who were able to conquer Canada, & drive their enemies out of their country, will always have it in their power to defeat their future projects should they be weak enough to make any future attempts to regain what they lost. I do therefore exhort you by this Belt to pay no regard to such deceivers for the future, but continue to live peaceably & let me know who they are, & from whence that attempt to impose upon you. I likewise desire you to remember all your engagements with the English to observe the treaty of Peace with the Cherokees, to avoid any irregularities on the Frontiers & pay due regard to the Boundary Line now made, & to make all your People acquainted with it, & to keep the Roads & Waters open and free whereby you will enjoy the benefits of Peace & Commerce, the esteem of the King of Great Britain & the friendship of all his subjects & I desire you will remember & often repeat my words. A Belt. Brothers, the Indians of Canada, With this Belt I recommend it to you to remember what has been done at this & all former Treaties and to make the same public among all your people on your return to Canada recommending it to them to continue to promote peace and to discountenance all evil reports & idle Stories which may be propagated by ignorant or bad men & to communicate all useful intelligence to me from time to time as a proof of your regard for your engagements & a means of recommending yourselves to the esteem of the King and people of England. A belt. Brothers of the several Nations here Assembled, The Governor of New Jersey being called hence by some urgent business has desired me to inform you that he can not think of taking leave of His Brethren the Six Nations without once more expressing the Happiness he has received from finding that they entertain such right sentiments of his justice, & that of the good people under his Government. He has himself the highest sense of the value & importance of the name conferred on him & doubts not but that future Governors & the chief men & inhabitants of New Jersey will be ever careful to deserve so distinguished a Title among the Indian Nations as that of Sagorrihwhioughstha, Doer of Justice. The Governor has likewise requested me to remind you that at a Treaty held at Easton in the year 1758, the Delawares and other Indians who had any pretensions to Land in New Jersey, did for a valuable consideration give a general release for all the Lands in that Province except such parts as were reserved by Law for the use of those Indians who chose to live under the protection of that Governmt. This was done in public Council in the presence of many of the Six Nations and the Governor would therefore be glad, that at this Congress (where are present so many chiefs of the different Nations belonging to the Confederacy & when a general Boundary Line between the subjects of His Brittannic Majesty in America & their Brethren the Indians is to be settled) you would do the Province of New Jersey the justice to confirm the said Release by acknowledging in public that that Province is entirely free from all Indian Claims, except as before mentioned. His Reason for this request is that this matter may held in remembrance by all the nations present & by that means be more surely handed down to their Posterity. A Belt. Brothers, In consequence of a Belt I have just received from the Senecas which I formerly gave them to bind them together I do now think it highly necessary with this Belt to bind you all together recommending it to you all to avoid wandering and to continue at your several villages after the manner of your ancestors. I do this principally for your own advantage, convinced that you will be weakened by rambling and that your Councils and opinions will be thereby disunited. Take therefore my advice and do not suffer yourselves to be led away with any imaginary prospects of advantage by scattering, but continue by this Belt in your several places of abode following your commerce and all peaceable pursuits. A Large Black Belt. Brothers, The business of the Treaty being so far happily brought to a conclusion it only remains that you execute a deed of Cession to His Majesty & whatever else is necessary on this occasion, after which I shall deliver over to your People the large Present, together with the Sum of Money the amount and value of which I have already explained to you. The Governors and Gentlemen Commanders from the several Governmts are sensible of your good conduct during the Treaty, and I shall recommend what is necessary to them in your presence for its further security & on the part of New York I take upon myself to promise you that every thing necessary thereto shall be recommended and I make no doubt agreed to by the Legislature of this Province, heartily wishing that the same may on your parts be as carefully observed & that no disputes may hereafter arise concerning any part of the Cession you have made or the engagements you have entered into at this time. Then Sir William addressed the Governor of New Jersey & the Commissioners. Gentlemen. Agreeable to His Majesty's intentions signified to me by the secretary of State and for the satisfaction of the several Nations here assembled I take the liberty to recommend it strongly to your several Provinces to enact the most effectual Laws for the due observance of this Line & the preventing all future intrusions, as the expectations thereof and the reliance the Indians have on your Justice from the Assurances I gave them on that head have proved great inducements to the settlement of the Line now established between the Colonies and them. To this the Governors & Commissioners answered that nothing should be wanting on their parts to the obtaining such security for the Boundary as was deemed necessary on their return to their respective Colonies. Then Sir William at the desire of the Gentlemen Commissioners from Pennsylvania acquainted the Indians, that they the Commissioners had a present ready to the amount of 500 Dollars to give in full satisfaction of the Conostoga Lands, which by the death of that People became vested in the Proprietaries. That they freely gave this sum as a farther Proof of the regard of that Province for them and of their concern for the unhappy fate of the Conostogas. Then Sir William told the Indians, that as the proprietaries did not know whether they would choose money or Goods for the addition of Land to Pennsylvania they were then unprovided, but that Sir William Johnson would be answerable for the speedy payment of the purchase, & would propose to them either to receive it in money to be sent on the Commissioners' return or in goods speedy as possible or to wait till the next spring by which time they could have goods better & more for the same money from England which was submitted to their determination. As it grew late Sir William dismissed the Indians till the next day when they were to subscribe to the Deed of Cession & receive the consideration.",0.045,0.166,0.789,0.9998,False,True,1768,10,24,1768,11,5

Being persuaded that there are among you, as many other Nations, mischievous Birds that whisper into your Ears all manner of bad news and Falsehoods to disturb your well being and unanimity in order to bring you into strife & trouble. I therefore by this String of Wampum earnestly advise you not to give ear to such Birds but give due attention to what I am going to tell you it being meant for your Welfare, and what you may depend upon as Fact and real Truth. A String of Wampum. Children- I dare say you are acquainted that the King your Father had at last been obliged to chastise & correct his undutiful & rebellious children the Bostonians for attempting to disown and rise against him who has always been a tender & affectionate Father rearing them from their Infancy with a great deal of care & Expence until they grow strong & able to support themselves. No sooner did they arrive to that state of maturity & ease, but they most shamefully & ungratefully forgot their filial Duty & affection & even when they thought themselves formidable enough, they rose against him in order to disposses him of a country he legally owned near Two hundred years. Aye become Possessors & Masters both of that and the Indian Country, for which reason you must be sensible that they first began with the Indians upon the Ohio, endeavouring to drive them off & settle this Country by Force of Arms and were they to obtain their end that would soon drive all the Indians from their Lands & become their masters. But their efforts have hitherto proved ineffectual by means of the King your Father's superior Force both by Sea & Land and they losing ground and growing weaker every day and confused in their Councils they were inconsiderate enough to send a party of their People once more into the Indian Country by way of the Illinois, and I am sorry to say the Indians were so blind to their interest as to suffer them to penetrate as far as St. Vincennes and Tuscarrawas whereby they not only run the risk of losing their country but the supplies for every necessary of Life they want which they must get from this country, the rebels being destitute of everything themselves as the King your Father's ships stop up all their ports that no goods can get in; and as the Bostonians know that the river St. Lawrence is open whereby all the Indian Nations in Canada are plentifully supplied with every article in Trade they made an attempt to get possession in their country in order to seize upon the Traders & their goods which is the Reason that I have stopped my People who are trading among you from setting out as early as usual for fear of running the risk their Lives & Property & your being deprived of your necessaries. Do let me tell you children that if you don’t endeavour to keep our country clear of these People for the future you must expect to do entirely without trade as I won't expose my people's lives & property if they can't go into your country with safety. I think it is the bast thing for so numerous a body of People as you are to keep a handful of Bostonians out of it. I for my part have not been idle for these 4 years past to keep this River open that you may have our supplies and defend this country from the Incursions of the Rebels, who make frequent attempts to attack it in order to cut off the communication with you which point if they should gain would deprive YOU of every kind of clothing & ammunition for the King your father's Ships would immediately block up this River that not a single ship of the Rebels or their allies with merchandise could get in, so that you must be convinced that it is for your essential welfare and interest to do your part & keep your country clear of the Bostonians. A large Belt. Children, As to the stories these evil birds carry about and whisper into your ears with regard to your former fathers the French coming among you again. I shall tell you the Truth of the matter and you may depend upon it as a Fact for I never told an untruth yet in my Life. The Bostonians seeing themselves not able enough to stand up against their Father the King, sent some of their most cunning men, to your former father the King of France telling him many false stories how rich and able they were to fight against their father the King of England, but that they had no large ships like his. If therefore the French King would only hire them some of his big Ships to fight for them they would pay him well & trade with him. The french would not for a long while agree to their request till they begged and promised him so much that at last they prevailed on him to send outlarge ships to help the Bostonians which was last summer & accordingly they Joined the Bostonian Army at Rhode Island. As soon as the King of England's Ships at New York heard of it they went in search of them and when they came in sight of the french ships they immediately left the Bostonians and went to sea & the English ships pursuing them could not stop them to fight but had some shot at them now and then, since that the French ships went to the West Indies where the English followed them & taking a french Island the french General wanted to take it from them again with his Fleet & army but was beat off with the Loss of 3000 men & run away to another Island where he is now shut up by the English Fleet & dare not come to fight them & your Father the King of England has now such a numerous fleet which within the 12 months has been so successful in the East Indies & everywhere that the French Fleet wont show itself. Now the King of France is so angry with the Bostonians that they brought them into this Quarrel that he won't send them a ship or a man more, and you won't see him so soon for which reason I have called some of your People that wintered at Montreal to come to this place where I convinced them that there was no French ship here or in the mouth of this River this Spring. I can assure you Children that whenever I find that the french will get the better of this Country I shall act the same part which your late father Vaudreuil as to acquaint you of it myself, till then I beg you will keep yourselves quiet follow your hunting & trade & keep the Bostonians out of your country in order to enjoy peace & plenty.",0.104,0.096,0.799,-0.7672,True,False,1779,7,2,1779,7,2

My words have proved true, you have lost your Traders and I have only to pity you. open your ears and attend now to what I am going to say. The Spaniards tell you they are in alliance with the Virginians and the French, They therefore offer you their Hands, or threaten to destroy your Women and Children. Believe me, they can never destroy them until you are simple enough to shake hands with them. If you adhere to your alliance with the King of Great Britain and his Indian Friends, nothing can hurt you. The Spaniards in the time of your Ancestors, by fair words when they failed by force of Arms, got possession of an Indian Country the other side of the Mississipi, where they Killed Thousands of the Inhabitants to get the stuff that those Bracelets and Gorgets you are now wearing are made of. You have no such Clay in your ground at St. Josephs, but you find fertile Lands which will produce abundance of corn. If therefore you listen to those sugarmouthed Spaniards, what would the Spirits of your ancestors say if they knew that their Burying Grounds were to be levelled by Ploughs, and their Bones disturbed for the Spaniards and Virginians to sow Corn, Whilst you, their descendants, tamely came to Detroit to beg a little piece of Land from the Ottawas to hide yourselves, which must be the case soon unless you are determined to stand firm as the Oak which grows upon your Land. Do not be afraid to trouble the Lands because there are Indians foolish enough to join them. If you are afraid, I am not. Therefore to prevent yourselves the affront, return to St. Josephs and bring me the chiefs Seguinack and Makewine, or I will find others from Michilimackinac to do it. Do you not know that they are the outcasts of their Nations? I once bought those Renegade Chiefs off in hopes that they would return to a sense of their duty. I am now determined no longer to spare them Whilst some of you look out for your Enemies, let others fresh cover the Graves of your Ancestors, and raise the earth so high over them that no plough can level them. Mr. Baby shall furnish you with ammunition and such things as are absolutely necessary. You must not expect ornaments or conveniences till you show yourselves thoroughly deserving of them. Children, the English always have treated you well, and the Indians on the other side the Mississippi are so sensible of the goodness of an English Father that they have invited him to send his troops to drive the Spaniards out of the country. They are now about it, and are helping those Indians to revenge themselves upon their enemies. Tell Nanaquoibe and Betagusliach their old Michilimackinac Father speaks to them.

This evening only a small quantity will be given to make merry with Some good news arrived by the last vessels shall be communicated to you in proper time, 'tis now too late.Children! I have good news to communicate to you, brought by Captain McKee, who has escaped from Fort Pitt, to join his hand to ours, the accounts he brings are confirmed by papers from Quebec. You are assembled here for to hear this good news, to be made acquainted with my sentiments and to deliver your own.Children! I have to inform you that His Excellency the Commander in Chief has written to me, signifying that he is about to cross Illinois great Lake to see the King his master, that he is to be succeeded by a great man whose name is Haldimand, but whose Indian name is not yet known. He is however well known thro' this country, having been Chief Warrior at New York, he is a brave officer, a wise man, and esteemed by all who know him. The Commander in Chief acquainted me in his letter that this Chief would write his mind to me, whenever he does, I shall communicate to you whatever relates to your interests whether for war or peace. I shall rise up, or sit down, as he orders me. The King has ordered me to give you an ax, he has not as yet told me to bring it. Whenever he does, my children shall know it immediately. My design is to satisfy all my children if possible, I have always told them the truth, some of you have long been pressing me to allow you to go to war directly, however the most impatient have waited at my Request, perhaps some wish to know what orders I shall receive from my superiors, I am well pleased it should be thus, since I think my children are sufficiently numerous to go to assist their Brothers, the Hurons and Shawnee, & also to leave some in their villages, till orders come from the great chief at Quebec. The Great Spirit has given us but one mind, I hope he will continue his goodness to us. I still look to Quebec, for the King's orders have not as yet reached this remote place this year. Some Delawares are this day arrived who are desirous of showing their intention of joining their brethren have presented me two pieces of dried meat scalps, one of which I have given the Chippewa, another to the Miamis, that they may show in their villages the disposition of the Delaware. Children! you may remember that when you first received your Father's War axe, I told you, he would have attention to your necessities, while you acted the part of dutiful children. I have often told you that w T hat you receive does not come from me but from the King who has thought of you, tho' at a great distance, & has sent you ammunition, clothing other matters necessary for you. Children! I have always endeavored to assist you in your necessities, this day you will receive what is allotted for you, in such a manner that each person will have a share. The King has also sent me some marks df his approbation to be given to those, who have listen'd to him & gained the esteem of their nation. The number which has merited this distinction is too great to admit of all receiving at this time, but I have my eyes fixed on those who shall receive them in course of time. I have to request of you Chiefs, that you will keep up the same good order I have hitherto observed among you, and which deserves my hearty thanks, but you have the approbation of my master the King for your good behavior in War, as well as peace which I take great pleasure in acquainting you with. I shall finish this day's business by delivering what is prepared for each nation according to its numbers & I return thanks to the Great Spirit for giving us clear skies and good weather at this general meeting. The union and good understanding which appears among us all proceeds from his goodness to us. Children! If any of you have anything to say further, let me hear it, this is the place and time for seeing your hearts.Children ! I shall say a few words to you all, and desire you to be attentive. I have heard the good advice you have given the Delawares, accept this Belt as a proof of my approbation, you have said nothing but what is true & what I shall support. My Children the Delawares ! I have a few words for you. Listen to the War & Village Chiefs who have spoken very properly to you & who shall never resent what the King shall be pleased to order for their supply observe that some ill advised people among you have said that the Hurons were the only people who complain'd of the road towards the Rebels being blocked up by you, & that they alone sent you Belts, I must remark to you that all the nations here present agree in opinion with the Hurons & that I am entirely of their way of thinking also, I therefore give you this Belt to carry to your Village & to be sent round to all the Delawares that they may grow wise. I have not forgot the conduct of White Eyes who came with speeches to this council last year, nor do I forget how I treated him and the speeches he brought. I hope my children the Delawares will be wise that when they come to my council fire, they may see clear & that I may give them my hand which I refused to White Eyes. You, Captain James, took hold of your Father's Axe yesterday. Hold it fast, be wise & remember that the Belt I present you with repeats all the words of the War and Village Chiefs whom you have heard speak this day. A Belt.  My Children! Ottawas, Chippewa, Hurons &c. I have always wished to promote friendship among the Indian Nations but such as do not take hold of the chain of friendship I gave you last year or attempt to break shall know and feel its strength. Children! War Chiefs, Village Chiefs, Warriors &c. it has pleased God I should meet you all here a second time in general council, the fire I first lighted for you burnt clear, & I hope this one will blaze yet clearer & its smoke ascend to the clouds. The great Spirit is good to all his creatures, he has given you sense & courage & one heart to think as well as one hand to act for the King your Father, if I have any sense, 'tis from him, who gives you understanding, I am happy to meet my children & I feel that I am their friend and Father. I will always tell you the truth & never deceive you. When you first took up your Father's axe, you asked me how you should act, I consulted with your wise men & experienced War Chiefs. God has been favorable to our Councils. I tell you the same this year, before you go to War, I shall consult with your Chiefs. I have already told you my thoughts that you are sufficiently numerous to drive the Rebels from the Rivers that water your hunting grounds, & at the same time to leave Warriours in your Villages to act under their experienced War Chiefs, when the King's orders arrive, which are not come over the Great Lake. I thank you Outawas, Hurons &c. for your sensible speeches, which I shall lay up in my heart.Senecas! You have pleased me in speaking as you have, and I shall acquaint the Six Nations with your good sense in joining hands with us all present, & you will tell them what you have been Witnesses to. Snip! You have spoken the Sentiments of the Mingoes & I thank you & all those who show good sense before this assembly, I shall not forget your words nor that you helped Captain McKee to find the road to this place.Children! When I gave you the axe of your Father the King last year; You turned your Medals behind you, that you might see more easily the Rebels his Enemies. You may perceive he takes care of all his children, I give you these Medals that you may think on him who threw down the French King who was once your Father but is no longer so You have but one, for which reason I take from your necks the old French Medals & replace them with those of your true and only father. Perhaps others among you merit such a distinguishing mark, I shall be glad to have the sense of the several nations on the subject, which shall be treated on some future day. English Medals were then given & French ones taken off.",0.077,0.175,0.749,0.9998,False,True,1778,6,14,1778,6,20

I am glad to find you did not meet with any obstacle in your way, you are wellcome, as I know the loss you have met with in the death of your great Chief Wa-bene-kiah & his son & some others, has justly grieved you very much, I shall condole with you before I enter into any discourse. Then according to their custom condoled with them, by giving White Wampum, black strouds &c. &c. to cover the graves and bones of their dead & told them they should get a small quantity of Rum every day while they remained here & when they went away would receive a little to take to their villages &c. - - To morrow morning I shall meet you again & let you know (according to your desire) my Sentiments as well as those of all the nations in this neigh- borhood. In the mean time here is a party of my children the Poutawattamies who are going to war, I am glad you will have an opportunity to see them before they go away, by which you may judge of the intentions of the rest. Children! You are assembled here to hear what I have to say to you, I pray you to pay attention, and I shall also hear what you may have to say. Six strings wanpum to each nation. Children! I am happy that you found the road so clear as you expressed to me the 29th June. I hope that your young men, &c., will trace the same path, & come in to see their Father. I should like to communicate to you the news we have received & what I have already communicated to all my children. The Rebells at the beginning of these troubles had the advantage in Can- ada, at that time we had nothing to apprehend or to fear; & had no occa- sion to have a number of troops. The Indians in this neighborhood at the beginning of this affair came to me & demanded an axe to act against the Rebells, who had rebell’d against their King & who meant to inhabit their lands. I told them, children, you had better wait untill we hear further; perhaps the King may command you to take the axe; that we may all act in concert throughout the colonies. What could they have done last war, if the King had not given them assistance 2 I speak to you of these things knowing you will know I speak the truth.—I speak to you who are an ancient nation—you know that last war the Spaniards joined the French & were obliged at last to ask peace—The English Forces have taken N. York, Boston, & Philadelphia, and driven the Rebels wherever they dare face them both by land & sea, & I believe in a little time the King will bring their Necks under his feet, & whenever they acknowledge their disobedience & return to their duty, The King will then acknowledge them for his children. The rebels not contented to act against their sovereign have also acted against the Indian nations and want to dispossess them of their Lands, the King always attentive to his dutyfull children ordered the axe to be put into the hands of his Indian children in order to drive the Rebels from their Land, while his ships of war & armys clear'd them from the sea. Children These strings are to remind you that the King never tried to take any of your Lands, but that it was the rebels, Six strings to each nation. Children! I now speak to you the three nations on the Ouabach to inform you that the Ottawas, Chippawas, Hurons, Pouatattamies, Senecas, Shawa- nese, &c. have hold of their father’s axe, & are all of one voice & will not burry it, untill the King their Father shall order peace. Thirteen strings. Children! It would have given me pleasure to have seen you here assembled in Council at the time it was held, but as you came too late, you will be in- formed of the Proceedings by some of your Friends or the Interpreters. Children! I am glad to see you all composed. What I am now going to say is of importance to you, your wives and children. I heard that the Spaniards have given sucor to the Rebels and given them what assistance they could. Notwithstanding they were rebels against their King & enemies to the Indian nations. I have heard that the Spaniards have said to you the Indians on the Ouabach, that they owned the Lands there, & that the King of England had no claims thereto. —I desire to know from you if it be true or not ? Is it possible that the Spaniards have forgotten already that they were obliged to ask for peace from the King of Great Britain & don’t they know that the King will protect his children the Indians in the security of their Lands & that no power whatever shall dispossess them—I give you the three nations, Qui-qua-bones, Wea & Mascontins each a Belt to assure you that the King will protect you from any power that may attempt to invade your just rights I have the King's orders to protect those that shall shew themselves his children. I don’t want to purchase your friendship with Liquor. The King knowing that his children who act with his axe, are unable to provide for themselves, has accordingly provided for them. I am persuaded you have worn out your shoes &c., I shall therefore give you something that when you return, your people may see you have given me your hands and are well received and perhaps they may tread the path you have done. I am well assured that the Delawares have acted in favour of the rebels, I have accordingly in Council deliver'd a Belt in my name and that of all the Nations neighboring here around and in the name of the six nations, that if they still continued to favor the Rebels, that I would with all my children look on them as rebels. The Lieutenant Governor changed their Medals and told them that they were from the King, he looks on you as his children, therefore wishes you should ware his picture, you not having any other Father but him, (Note) a medal given to Mahin-amba in lieu of a small English medal received in 1764. A Medal to Me-lou-son-ata in lieu of a french medal. A Do to Pi-e-mash-kee-canny in lieu of a Ditto. A Do to Sa-pa-ti-a who had not any before. Children! As you are all here present and wanting to return, I will finish what I have to say to you before we break up this meeting. I cannot but praise the behaviour of the Indian nations who have taken hold of their Father’s axe and who have acted as men. I hope you’ll act the same part and not redden your axe with with the blood of Women and Children or innocent men. I know that men, kill men and not children. I speak to you who are men. Fourteen strings. Ta-pa-ti-a then spoke: Father—You are in the right to ask of us our sentiments, we will inform you, we acknowledge you say right when you say this island is yours, it is true, some birds have told us otherwise, but we have not paid any atten- tion to them, we address ourselves to you, who is our true Father. Who are the Chiefs, that pretend to be ignorant that the French King has been conquered by the English. We the Indians on the Ouabash never pretend to go the Spanish side for succour, but come to your side as you are our Father, even the least of our children will know that we are at present the King of England’s children as we have been conquered by you. As to the Bigknives, we know them, we have rec’d your Belt in our Village, one of our chiefs is gone to take a walk with it towards them, he will soon return. All our War Chiefs are much pleased to go against the Virginians and act in concert with their brothers. Onr intention is never to act against children, but against men. We thank you for saying you’ll take care of us, we are assured that our young men will tread the path which we found so clear and smooth. Children! I am glad to hear you express your sentiments, agreeably to those of the other nations. Qui-qua-po-quois then spoke: Father! You are in the right to think that the Spaniards try to draw us to them, the son of old Tobacco, who is a pian in company with another were on the spanish side & asked us to go, we would not, we told them we had you for a father—we saw a road and our eyes were open, & we followed your path well beaten. Father! Believe that we the Wea, Qul-qua-bones and Mascontins are all as one man and we are sincere for you—don’t imagine that altho’ we go for ""Rum to the Spaniards that they have our hearts! 3rd July 1778. The Chiefs &c. assembled as the 1st July. The Lieut Gov. then presented an axe to Cha-ka Wea war Chiefs, told him that as he sang on the axe belonging to Peemembekeetach (a Poutawatoamé War chief) he now presented him an axe for his use to act against those people who want to possess themselves of your Land it’s the King’s command that I put this axe into your hands to act against His Majesty’s Enemies. I pray the Master of Life to give you success as also your warriors, wherever you go with your Father’s axe. Cha-ha Ouiattonon War Chief received the axe with marks of satisfaction and sang the War song & presented it to a Ouiattonon War Chief who sang & presented it to Mis-quitto, Qui-qua-bones War Chief who sang and said Father! I have never as yet sang the war song, I am but a young man, notwithstanding I have killed men, I shall endeavor to sing.—Sings. Lieut Governor then spoke: I thank you Misquitto for having sharpened the Ouiattonon’s axe, I pre- sent you this axe (giving a War Belt) to use against the King’s Enemies, I am persuaded the Wea will sharpen it for you in 1eturn. Misquitto sings the war song & presents it to Cha-ha, Ouiattonon W. C. Cha-ha then spoke: Father! It gives me pleasure to see you have given the Qui-qua-bones, an axe, and that we the Wea should sharpen it as for my part I am almost ashamed to say anything as the Qui-qua-bones are greater warriors than we are. Sings. Lieutenant Governor presented a certificate to Qui-qua-po-quois for his attachment to His Majesty & Government. Ta-pa-ti-a spoke: Father! We return you thanks for your attention towards us, you have asked us what time we want to return to our villages. We answer you that we want to return directly if possible. You know that we Village chiefs have nothing to say in war, when we get at our villages, shall interpret everything which occurred to our War Chiefs who know how to act in War. Father! We hope you’ll provide us with Water carriages that we may be enabled to return speedyly. we are assured that everything is at your com- mand, therefore you can order us some with ease. Children! I have attended to what you have said, the same water carriages which brought you here shall take you back, as to what regards my children, I assure you I never shew more favor to one nation than another. I look on them as with one Eye and use them all alike.

The reason that called us to Council at those different places is that the Americans have given us great trouble since the peace concluded between you and them, in which we, the Indians were left out. Although it was our attachment to you that led us into your disputes, the treatment we have met with from the Americans has involved us in great difficulty and trouble, but we have at last agreed how to act in this important matter, which is to send a letter to Congress and propose for them to come and meet us half way between their conntry and ours, to treat with them on matters which may be mutually beneficial to us both. If they are so disposed, particularly respecting the Establishing a boundary line, as the only certain means of procuring a lasting peace between them and us We mean to do it on as reasonable terms as Equity and justice to ourselves will permit. The first steps we desire them to take, is to forbid their people crossing the Ohio River till our negotiation will take place, which we propose to be in about four months from this day. we have for this end appointed deputies from our late Councils to go to all the nations both South ward and Westward to make them acquainted with our resolutions, and to require them to be in readiness and to assemble by the time appointed, to defend themselves & their rights if necessity requires, but in the mean time to keep within their own limits untill we see farther. This, Father and Brethren, is the purport of our late Council at the Huron Village and which we finish on the 18th Instant. Father and Brethren, We have now told you the heads of the different matters that were transacted at our late Council, and we earnestly beg of you to reflect seriously upon the consequences and our critical situation. It was from an attachment to your interests that we made enemies of the Americans, and we are still involved in hostilities, whilst you are enjoying the blessings of Peace, of which we, your allies, have not hitherto felt the good effects. This you must acknowledge yourselves is a hardship, we again earnestly require your reflections upon our situation. you are not ignorant of the ad vantages the Americans would take of us, had they it in their power. We request as the great Representative of the King is now arrived on this Continent, that the English will give us such ample answers as the importance of the subject requires, we call it a subject of importance as our future welfare depends much upon the present prudent management of our affairs. We beg that there may be no delay on your part, to give us an answer, as our affairs with the Americans must absolutely be determined in about five months. Hence We will be happy if the English would previous to that period give us a determined answer, which we may rely on, and by all means freely to speak their sentiments, as far as it is consistent with the nature of our alliance.",0.046,0.153,0.8,0.9972,False,True,1786,12,24,1786,12,24

Johnson in the year 1768, at Fort Stanwix. Neither can I harbour an idea that the United States will act so unjustly or impolitically as to endeavour to deprive you of any part of your country under the pretext of having conquered it. The King still considers you his faithful allies as his children, & will continue to promote your happiness by his protection and encouragement of your usual intercourse with Trade, & all other benefits in his power to afford you. Therefore I do in the most earnest manner recommend to you for your own advantage, to bear your Losses with manly fortitude, forgiving & forgetting what is past, looking forward in full hopes and expectation that on the return of the Blessings of Peace, and cool and just reflection, all animosity and enmity will cease, conciliation succeed, and Friendship be renewed, and as a proof of your Inclination to promote that desirable end, let me once more recommend to you to collect and give up without exception all Prisoners that may be yet among you, and as an inducement to comply with what I recommend, and as a proof of His Majesty's Bounty and attention: I have brought up a large assortment of every thing necessary to supply your wants.Children! This speech is so fully expressive of everything that at present concerns your Interests, I have only to add that I earnestly enjoin the several Nations present to a strict adherence and compliance thereto, & I am happy to have it in my power at this time to deliver you a part of the Cloathing mentioned, which I natter myself will fulfill the Engagements heretofore made to you, and convince you that your Fathers attention is extended to all his children and having finished what I have to say on our Part, I desire your attention to the Deputies of the Six Nations, who will lay before you the late Councils held at Niagara.I am rather surprised that you pretend ignorance of the business we came upon, when I had a meeting with you before I left Detroit on the arrival of the Deputies from the Six Nations. I told you they came to promote the general good, and that I thought it necessary for some chiefs to accompany me and their Elder Bretheren to this side of the Lake, in order to inform the several nations who are situated near the Americans of the particulars we have received of the Peace, that they may take care not to put themselves in the way of bringing mischief, upon themselves. What has now passed this day before this Assembly, is meant for your good, only, if you duly attend thereto, and as to the giving up of Prisoners, it has ever been a custom both with you and the white People, at the conclusion of a Peace to give them up. Therefore as that is now the case you can no longer consider yourselves deceived.Children! I return you my hearty thanks for your readiness, in complying with the requisition made by your Father and I am rejoiced to see you so unanimous in doing right. It fulfills the good end of my meeting you at this place, which is to promote your happiness and welfare, and I am well pleased to find you all so strong in this good work, and that a single breath which rashly blows, can have no effect in turning you aside from the strait path laid before you by your Father and Elder Brethren the Six Nations, who in the most solemn manner yesterday renewed the union of your Hearts & Interests, to enable you to speak and act like one man whilst you continue to do this, there can be no doubt but you will prosper in your endeavours to live happy.

100,1754-06-21.txt,Treaty of 1754,1754-06-20,1754-06-21,,,,,Non-Native,British,"Brethren — We are very glad to see you, and sorry that such reports 
disquiet you. The English do not intend to hurt you, or any of your 
allies ; this news, we know, must have been forged by the French, who 
are constantly treacherous, asserting the greatest falsehoods • whenever 
they think they will turn out to their advantage ; they speak well, promise fine things, but all from the lips outward ; whilst their heart is corrupted and full of venomous poison. You have been their children, and 
they would have done every thing for you, but they no sooner thought 
themselves strong enough, than they returned to their natural pride, and 
drove you off from your lands, declaring you had no right on the Ohio.
The English your real friends, are too generous, to think of using the Six 
Nations, their faithful allies, in like manner ; when you made your address to the Governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania ; they, at your repeated request, sent an army to maintain your rights ;t to put you in the 
possession of your lands, and to take care of your wives and children, to 
dispossess the French, to support your prerogatives, and to make that 
whole country sure to you ; for those very ends are the English arms actually employed ; it is for the safety of your wives and your children, 
that we fight, and as this is the only motive of our conduct, we cannot 
reasonably doubt of being joined by the remaining part of your forces, to 
oppose the common enemy. 

Those that will not join us, shall be answerable for whatever may be 
the consequence ; we only desire your brethren to choose that side which 
shall be most agreeable to them. 

The Indians of the Six Nations are those, who have the most interest 
in this war; for them it is that we fight ; and it would greatly trouble me 
to do them the least hurt ; we have engaged in this war in order to assist 
and protect you ; our arms are open to receive you, and our hands ready 
to nourish your families during the course of this war. The Governor 
of Virginia has often desired they might be sent to him, that he might 
see them in person, nourish and clothe them according to their own desire ; but as you could not be determined to send them to him, we are 
ready to share in a friendly manner, all our provisions with you, and 
shall take such measures, and give such orders, that enough shall be 
brought to maintain your wives and children. Such a conduct will evidently prove how much more the English love and esteem their allies the 
Six Nations! I than the French do. As we have drawn the sword in 
your cause, and in your defense, delay not one moment, be no more in 
suspense, but put your wives and children under our protection ; and they 
shall find plenty of provisions ; in the mean while, set your young men 
and your warrior to sharpen their hatchets, in order to join and unite 
with us vigorously in our battles. 

The presents, my brethren, which I offer you, is not so considerable 
as I could wish, but 1 expect in a short time a quantity of goods, which 
are to be at my disposal, in order to reward those who shall have shown 
themselves brave and active on this occasion ; however, I shall recompense them most generously.It la true that the Indians of the Six Nations have inhabited the borders of the Ohio; neither do they pretend any right to them, but the English who, in America, tie them as friends and allies, would fain persuade them, that the borders of the Ohio belong to the Six Cantons, under pretense of some ancient wars that these had, with the Indians on the Ohio. And in Knrope they Insist, that that country belongs to England, and pretend that the Indians of the Six Nations, are its subjects. 

It Here the English confess, that country is none of theirs; of what can they then reproach the French ? 
It would more become the Indians of the Six Nations to complain; yet they do not. 

I So this is the reason of the war against the French, protection due to the Six Nations, who never 
complained. 

I The grand argument of the English in Europe, to assume the country which lies on the other aide of Appalachian mountains, is, that the Six Nations are their subjects, how can we reconcile that, with the reaeouiuga they hold with the Six Nations when they speak to them ? 


Be of good courage, my brethren, deliver your country, and make it 
sure to your children ; let me know the thoughts of your hearts on this 
affair, that I may give an account of your sentiments to your great friend 
and brother, the Governor of Virginia. In order to assure yea of my 
sincerity and esteem, I present you this belt.

have made yourself dearer to us than ever ; we return you our thanks that 
you did not go to Venango, when the French first invited you there; 
their treating you in such a childish manner, as we perceive they do, raises in us a just and strong resentment. They call you their children, and 
speak to you, as if you in reality were children, and had no more understanding than such. 

Consider well my brethren, and compare all their discourse, and you 
will find that all it tends to, is to tell you, I am going to open your eyes, 
to unstop your ears, and such like words to no purpose, only proper to 
amuse children. You also observe brethren, that if they deliver a speech, 
or make a promise, and confirm it by a belt, they imagine it binds them 
no longer than they think it consistent with their interest to stand to it. 
They have given one example of it, and I will make you observe it, in the 
jump which they say they have made over the boundaries, which you had 
set them; which ought to stir you up my brethren, to a just anger, and 
cause you to embrace the favorable opportunity that we offer you, as we 
are come, at your request, to assist you, and by means of which, you may 
make them jump back again, with more speed than they advanced. 

A string of wampum. 

The French are continually telling you, not to give heed to the ill reports that are told you concerning them who are your fathers. If they did 
not know in their very souls, now richly they deserve it on your account, why should they suspect being accused ? Why should they forewarn you of it, in order to hinder you from believing what is told you 
concerning them ? With regard to what they tell you of us, our conduct 
alone will answer in our behalf; examine the truth yourselves ; you know 
the roads leading to our habitations, you have lived amongst us, you 
can speak our language; but in order to justify ourselves from whatever might be said against us, and assure you of our brotherly love ; we once more invite your old men, your wives and your children, to take 
sanctuary under our protection, and between our arms, in order to be plentifully fed, whilst your warriors, and young men join with ours, and expose 
together the common cause. 

A string of wampum. 

Brethren, we thank you with all our hearts, for having declared onto 
us, your resolution of accomplishing the engagements which you bad entered into, at the treaty of Loiston, and we can do no otherwise than 
praise your generous conduct with regard to your grand sons, the Shawanese ; it gives us infinite pleasure. 

We are greatly obliged to the counsel given you by Onondago, charging 
you to hold fast the chain of friendship by which we are bound ; I dare 
say, that had he known, bow nearly you are interested in this war, or 
that it is for the love of you, and at your request,t we have taken up arms, 
he would have ordered you to declare, and to act immediately against the 
common enemy of the Six Nations. In order to assure you of my affection, and to confirm the truth of what I have said, I present you these two

His Excellency's Answer to the Delaware and Six Nation Chiefs:  

Brethren: I now wipe the tears from your eyes, which you may have shed for the loss of any of your people. I remove the grief from your hearts which it may have occasioned. I also clear your ears from any bad reports, that you may now look upon your brethren, the Virginians, with friendship, and that you may believe what I am about to say to you in your hearts, and receive it with pleasure. (A string.)

Brethren : With these trifling goods I cover the graves of your deceased friends, that the remembrance of your grief upon that occasion, may be buried in total oblivion. (Condolence present.)

Brethren : Your desire is gratified ; I do see clearly, and the sweat and fatigue I have experienced on my journey here, will be no cause of complaint to me, when I find an opportunity to convince my brethren, the Delawares and Six Nations, of my good intentions towards them. You may be assured, brethren, that as I am now here present, I shall be able to hear plainly, and to distinguish clearly what is just and unjust between me and my brethren, the Indians. (A string.)

Brethren : I am much obliged to you for the pains you have taken to heal the sores made by the Shawanese, and would have been very glad to have now given you a more favorable answer as to them ; but you yourselves must be well acquainted how little the Shawanese deserve the treatment or appellation of brethren from me, when, in the first place, they have not complied with the terms prescribed to them by Colonel Bouquet (and to which they assented) of giving up the white prisoners; nor have they ever truly buried the hatchet; for the next summer after that treaty, they killed a man upon the frontiers of my Government; the next year they killed eight of my people upon Cumberland river, and brought their horses to their towns, where they disposed of them (together with a considerable quantity of peltry) to the trader from Pennsylvania. Some time after, one Martin, a trader from my Government, was killed with two men, on Hockhocking, by the Shawanese, only because they were Virginians ; at the same time permitting one Ellis to pass, only as he was a Pennsylvanian. In the year 1771, twenty of my people were robbed by them, when they carried away nineteen horses, and as many owned by Indians, with their guns, clothes, &c., which they delivered up to one Callender and Spears, and other Pennsylvania traders in their towns. In the same year, on the Great Kenhawa, in my Government, they killed one of my people and his brother and the year following, Adam Stroud, another of my people, his wife and seven children, were most cruelly murdered on Elk waters. In the next year, they killed Richards, another of my people, on the Kanhawa. A few moons after, they killed Eussel, one of my people, and five white men and two negroes, near Cumberland Gap ; and also carried their horses and artifacts into their towns, where they were purchased by the Pennsylvania traders. All these, with many other murders, they have committed upon my people, before a drop of Shawanese blood was spilt by them ; and have continually perpetrated robberies upon my defenseless frontier inhabitants, which at length irritated them so far that they began to retaliate. I have now stated the dispute between them and us, and leave it to you to judge what they merit. (A belt.)

Brethren: You desire me to listen to my brethren, the Five Nations, the Mohawks, the Wyandots, and to my brethren the Delawares. I do so with the utmost attention, and am well pleased to return you my thanks for the pains you have taken, and am extremely happy, and exceedingly desirous that the eyes of the Western Nations, and all others, may be continually fixed upon me ; for then they will plainly see that my real intention and sincere desire, is only to do justice to all parties. Brethren, I hope our pleasure at meeting is mutual; and you may be assured, from my late proceedings, that my good will towards you is most sincere, and I rejoice equally with you at the new life, your women and children have acquired by my arrival ; and I most sincerely wish that they may long continue in a full enjoyment of peace and happiness, to which I will most cheerfully contribute my utmost assistance.

Brethren: I am very glad to find that the Chiefs of the different Nations have a due and friendly regard to the friendship formerly subsisting between our forefathers, which I shall be happy at all times to continue. I am glad to observe that few, if any, of the foolish people who have been the authors of the late troubles, were in any wise particularly connected with you ; and I hope that our ancient friendship is too strongly linked to be broke by a few banditti of a distant Nation. I own I am very much rejoiced at my arrival here, as I hope it will be the means of adding fresh strength to the ancient chain of friendship subsisting between us; and particularly BO, as I see your inclinations are to facilitate this good work. I acknowledge myself your elder brother, and shall, on every occasion, manifest my regard as such towards you ; and I do expect that you will continually look up to me as your elder brother, from whom you may be assured of the strongest marks of brotherly kindness, either in peace or war. And as you may now be certain of protection from your elder brother, I flatter myself you will continue to tread the ancient path towards him here, when he will be answerable that the most ample justice shall be done you.

His Lordship's answer to their reply: Brethren : I am glad to find that what I have said in our late conference has been satisfactory to you ; and you may be assured that whatever I have promised shall be confirmed, so that my actions shall convince you of the sincerity of my heart. I am glad to find you have a desire of instructing your children in the Christian religion, which will be the cause of peace remaining between us on a lasting footing, and of adding happiness to your own nation.

Brethren : I have already informed you of the evil disposition of the Shawanese towards us ; but to convince you how ready the Big Knife is to do justice, at all times, even to their greatest enemies, at the request of my good brethren, the Six Nations, and you the Delawares, I will be ready and willing to hear any good speeches which the Shawanese may have to deliver to me, either at Wheeling, where I soon purpose to be, or, if they should not meet me there, at the little Kenhawa, or somewhere lower down the river. (A string.) Brethren : (The Mohawks,) You will hear by my speech to my younger brethren, the Delawares, that I am prevailed upon to listen to the Shawanese, notwithstanding their bad behaviour towards my people, and as I am prevailed upon merely by the confidence I repose in the friendship of my brethren, the Wyandots and Five Nations, I expect this will be looked upon as a strong proof of my regard for them ; and as it is your wish, I will meet the Shawanese at one of the places mentioned in my answer to my younger brethren, the Delawares, provided they are led to the Council Fire by my brethren, the Mohawks, the Wyandots and the Delawares, as I shall be satisfied that whatever they may then promise you my brethren will see them strictly adhered to.'

States, you must have seen that displeasure in my countenance, for it is not easy for me to conceal my feelings, what I feel in my heart, appears on my face, but while you have discovered my dissatisfaction, you have wondered what can be the cause, you wonder why, the British and Americans, people of one colour, cannot sit side by side at a Treaty with the Indians. 
 
 BROTHERS, I will tell you the reason, and then you will cease to wonder, I expected to have done this yesterday but the deaths of the Oneida Chiefs, obliged us to postpone the business till today, and I do not now regret the delay, for it would then have been more difficult: to have restrained my indignation at the intrusion of a British Spy ; to excuse Mr. Johnston's appearance, at this Council, you have told me that he came by your invitation, and you speak of him as having the care of you. Why then Brothers did he not come along with you? Will he pretend he was not ready? if he has the care of you, he ought to be ready at your call, or if an unforseen accident prevented his starting with you, why did he not come forward with Mr. Street who has been here many days. 
 
 BROTHERS, I will tell you why he did not come before, notwithstanding your invitation, he would have staid at home, for he saw the impropriety of intruding himself into the Councils of the U. States he had not assurance, he had not impudence enough, to come without orders from his employers, he therefore waited untill Governor Simcoe arrived from the Westward, and as soon after as he received his orders, and instructions, then he came forward, I am warranted therefore in calling him a British Spy. 
 
 BROTHERS, When it was proposed that a treaty should be held, between you and the United States you requested that I might be appointed to kindle the Council fire, hence I supposed that you had a confidence in me, grounded on your experience of my attention to your interests, when you desired some Gentlemen of the Society of Quakers might be present, I supposed it arose from the confidence you placed in them founded on the remembrance of their kindness to you, and to your forefathers, and a belief that they would be unwilling to countenance any attempts to wrong you, now Brothers, when they and I have come forward under these circumstances, upon your special invitation what do you think must be our sentiments on seeing a British Agent introduced to be a Spy on our Conduct. 
 
 BROTHERS, You have often intimated to me that it was pride, which pre- vented the Americans from sitting side by side with the English in Treaties with the Indians. 
 
 BROTHERS, For myself, I confess that I am proud, but mine is not the pride of rank, for mine is not much elevated, and in every station I have considered, and treated the poorest, and lowest of mankind as my Brothers, 'tis not the pride of wealth, for I am not rich, 'tis not the pride of knowledge, for I have but little, 'tis not the pride of understanding for mine is moderate, 'tis not the pride of eloquence for I am an indifferent speaker; what then makes me proud? conscious integrity and truth: proud in truth, I will not deceive you, proud in integrity, I will never do you wrong. 
 
 BROTHERS, You have invited Mr. Johnston to attend this Council but did you ever invite an American agent to attend your Councils, with the British or suppose you had given such an invitation suppose the President had sent one of our Interpreters here (pointing to Mr. Parish & Mr. Jones) to a Council you were holding with Governor Simcoe in Canada, how do you think our interpreter would be received, not feeling myself the height of British pride, I cannot truly describe to you his reception, if he were only ordered instantly to quit the Council, and the Province, and escape a kicking, or being put in Irons, he might think himself happy, Brother, this alone is a sufficient reason for excluding a British Agent from the Council fires kindled by the U. States, but there are many other reasons, some of which I will mention. 
 
 BROTHERS, We are a free, and independent Nation, treating with the Six Nations, who also profess to be free, and independent, and whatever difficulties arise between us, we can meet and confer on the means of removing them without the interference of any other Nation whatever, but especially brothers the U. States have never asked the mediation of the British and we never shall ask it, until they' give some proofs of their sincerity, Brothers, since we have been at war with the Western Indians, the United States have requested your assistance to bring about a peace between us and the people of your own colour, we asked your aid because we believed you to be our friends, and that you would act with sincerity, You complied with our request, and for more than two years you have been striving to restore peace, we thank you for your exertions although they have been unsuccessful, and why were they unsuccessful? What has prevented a peace between us and the Western Nations? I answer without hesitation, the British prevented it. 
 
 BROTHERS, In the Speech from the Western Indians sent you by Capt Brant, and which you have just repeated to me they say That when you and they met last summer, the business did not go on according to the desire of the meeting and they subjoin the reason of it. They were led astray. Now I ask who led them astray? Not the Six Nations, for they exerted themselves to keep them in the straight path that would have led to peace, who then led them astray? Not the U. States for you know we were not suffered to speak to them, who then I again ask, did lead them astray? I answer the British. 
 
 BROTHERS, When you returned last year from the Westward, you remember that you assembled at your Council fire at Buffaloe Creek, and that General Chapin was present, at that time Capt Brant, Col. Butler, Captn. Bunbury, Major Powel Mr. Sheehan & Mr. Johnston, being together one day at Winneys. Capt Brant asked Genl. Chapin what prevented the Treatys taking place between the Commissrs. of the U. States and the Western Indians. General Chapin answered he did not know but probably he Capt Brant could tell upon which Capt Brant replied, I will tell your what prevented it the British prevented it, and I say it here to their faces, the British were silent. 
 
 BROTHERS, I will not attempt to recount all the instances of British injustice, and British pride, that have produced the antipathy between them, and the Americans, which you have noticed, but I will tell you some of them. 
 
 BROTHERS, By the treaty of peace, the King engaged to give up to us all the Forts on the American side of the Boundary line then agreed on, yet he has kept possession of them to this day. I have heretofore told you what was Lord Dorchester's explanation of that Treaty as it respected the boundary line that beyond it the King would not extend his interference, yet he has not only kept possession of the old posts, but lately erected a new one over the Boundary line agreed on. You know that Governor Simcoe last Spring built a Fort at the foot of the rapids of the Miamis, and placed in it a garrison of British Troops. I must now tell you of a fresh piece of British Insolence. You all know that the Country where we are setting, is within the U. States, You Seneca's know that you sold this Country to Mr. Phelps, and that it extended along these lines (shewing them on the map) to Lake Ontario, here (shewing the place) the Eastern line came to Great Sodus Bay, this land was sold by Mr. Phelps, and now belongs to Capt Williamson who this Summer began a settlement at that Bay, as soon as this came to Governor Simcoe's Ears, he sent some of his officers with an order to Captain Williamson, to desist from his attempt and quit the Country, for he considered, that the Settlement as an encroachment on the King's rights. BROTHERS, We had long patiently endured the insolence of the British, but we shall endure it no longer, this gross insult was not to be borne, accordingly when Captain Williamson had reported Simooe's orders to the President of the U. States, and the Governor of New York. Orders were sent him to stand his ground, and oppose force to force, and the Governor of New York sent orders to me of his Chief Warriors, to get his Warriors ready, and if the British attempted to disturb the Settlement at Sodus Bay, to attack and kill them or drive them into the Lake. 
 
 BROTHERS, You recollect the violent inflammatory speech of Lord Dorchester's, which the British interpreted to you, last Spring at Buffaloe Creek, his talk was like that of Governor Simcoe, he said that a war would probably take place, between the British and Americans, and then the Settlements in all this Country here would be considered as encroachments on the right of the King. Brothers, that Speech of Lord Dorchester's was so carefully interpreted to you in order to prepare your minds for war, and to take up the hatchet oncemore, against the United States. 
 
 BROTHERS, Beyond no doubt it was the intention of the King, and his Counsellors, to make war on the U. States and for what? We had done them no injury. 
 
 BROTHERS, Since we refused to subscribe to their tyranny, since we threw the King on his back & established our independance, they have borne us no good will, they would gladly make another attempt to enslave us, and they thought a fair opportunity presented. I must tell you something about the affairs on the other side the Great Water, the French whom you knew, were governed by a King, his warriors assisted the Americans in the late war with the British, in America the French saw how we managed our affairs, that they were not directed by one man at his pleasure, but by wise counsellors whom we ourselves chose for the purpose, the French being an intelligent people, soon learnt how we conducted our business, and were pleased with it when they went home they wished to have their business managed in like manner by wise counsellors of their own choosing, and would no longer submit to the tyranny of a King, they accordingly threw him down, and out off his head, this Brothers enraged all the neighbouring tyrants called Kings, and they combined together and raised great Armies of regular Soldiers to oblige the French again to submit to be governed by a King, at that time the Tyrants expected easily to subdue the French, and prevent their becoming a free people, and as the French were the only Allies of the U. States, the British King, and his Counsellors, thought that would be a good time to attack us, and once more subject us to their tyranny, in pursuit of this object, Lord Dorchester made his inflammatory Speech to the Indians, to prepare them for a general war, and Simcoe, built his Fort, at the Rapids of the Miamis, and tried to break up the Settlement at Great Sodus, with the same view, the armed vessels of the King, stole our property on the great water, having taken hundreds of our vessels, laden with goods, to the value of many hundred thousand dollars, and not content with robbing us of our property, they put our Seamen on board of our Armed Vessells, and compelled them to fight against our Friends the French, these injuries were now too great to be borne any longer, so according to the custom of the white nations, our great chief sent one of his wise Counsellors, to demand satisfaction, and it is probable he will succeed in obtaining satisfaction, and prevent a war between the British and the U. States, for the minds of the King, and his Counsellors appear to be changed, they seem to have dropped the unjust design of making war upon us. They have seen that all the Tyrants combined against the French cannot subdue them, they have seen that the French will remain a free people, and that now it will be in vain to attempt to deprive us Americans of our liberty, the French Brothers, instead of being subdued, are now over running the Countries of the Tyrants, who attacked them. The French are a very great people, and on this occasion they have adopted the customs of the Indians, all their young men have become Warriors, and marched against their enemies, and beat them on all sides. Brothers, I shall pass by many instances of British pride, and deceit, but I must mention a few, you remember that last year Captain Brant and a large deputation of western Indians came to Niagara, and desired to speak to the American Commissrs. in presence of the Governor they spoke, and we returned an answer, in our answer we told them plainly, that in order to make peace, something must be yielded on both sides, that tho we were willing to run a new line, yet that it was impossible to make the Ohio the Boundary, that the U. States relying on the strength of former treaties had disposed of large quantities of Land over the Ohio, and that these could not be given up. 
 
 BROTHERS, Our answer appeared satisfactory to the deputation, and they then took us by the hand to lead us to Sandusky, at this Time Brothers, the people present at the Conference, even the British said the great difficulty was removed and that the Commissrs. and the Indians would doubtless agree in making peace, this it is well known was then the common conversation at Niagara the Deputation then returned, and the Commissrs. sailed to Detroit river to be at hand to proceed to Sandusky as soon as the great Indian Council should give us notice that they were ready, we had now a right to expect to be called without delay, to begin the treaty but after waiting some time at Detroit River another Deputation came to us there, and stated fresh difficulties, telling us that their first and great Deputation made a mistake, But Brothers, this was a mere pretense suggested by the British to prevent a Treaty, however we returned an answer, but great delays attending this mode of proceeding, the commissrs. concluded to sail to the mouth of the Miamis river so as to communicate easily with the Indn. Council, and as we had been made to believe at Niagara, that the vessel assigned for our use was to be under our direction, we desired the Capt. to get ready to sail the next day, but to our surprise, we were told he was directed to obey the orders of Captn Bunbury, we then spoke to Captn. Bunbury, and he told us he had the Governor's order in writing, not to suffer the Commissrs. to go to Miami River, but at the same time he said the Vessel should carry us to Sandusky if we desired it, in this manner brothers, we were deceived and insulted when we desired 'to go nearer the Indian Council, by the Governor's order we were prevented, at the same time we were told that if we pleased the vessel should carry us to Sandusky, that is much farther from the Indn. Council, than we then were, besides you know that the Western Indians had finally determined not to go to Sandusky at all, but being of themselves inclined to peace, in order to prevent the loss of time they concluded to meet the Commissrs, on the Miami River a few miles below the place where they then were sitting in Council, and you the Six Nations, as we were informed, actually moved down to the proposed place of meeting, you know whether or not this circumstance is true; (the farmer's Brother spoke and said it was true) now then I once more ask who prevented our succeeding in making peace with the Western Indians? I ans'd: the British, the very man who had repeatedly wished us success. Yes Brothers Governor Simcoe twice took me by the hand when I was leaving Niagara to go to the Treaty with the Western Indians and twice wished me success, although he had taken secret measures to prevent it Brothers I will mention one fact, last winter the western Indians sent Runners to the head Warrior of one Army with offers of peace, the head warrior answered that the United States were still willing to make peace but that if the hostile Indians were now sincere in their proposals, they must give evidence of it by collect. and bringing to his quarters, all the American prisoners, the runners then returned and the Indians were so satisfied with the answer, that they actually began to collect the prisoners in order to deliver them to our head warrior, but as soon as the British Agents heard this, they interfered and told the Indians they were fools, and that if they proceeded they would be deceived and cut off, Now Brothers I know the U. States were sincere in consenting at that time to make peace, for I had been myself desired to go to the Westward a Commr. to join our head Warrior in negotiating the terms of the Treaty, and I had consented to go, thus you see Brothers that whenever there was a prospect of making peace with the Western Indians the British have not failed to interfere and prevent it. 
 
 BROTHERS, These are my reasons for refusing to admit a British agt. at a Council fire kindled by the U. States, I could mention more but I am wearied of speaking as you must be in hearing, and surely .you must think the reasons I have offered to be sufficient, the facts I have mentioned I believe to be true, and the observations just, if there be any errors in my statement, they have arisen from mistake or misinformation, and not from design, I have but one thing more to mention, I am instructed by the President not to suffer a British Agent to attend this Council-fire. 
 
 BROTHERS, You now have my reasons, and my orders, if indeed I wished that the differences between the United States, and you should continue. If I wished that the important business for which this Council fire was kindled should be defeated. If I wished our chain of friendship should grow more rusty, if I wished it to become rotten, and break off, then I would advise to retain this British spy. 
 
 BROTHERS, It now remains with you to determine whether the great business for which we have met, shall go on or whether the Council fire shall be extinguished. You are a free, and independent people, and as such you will determine this question.",0.082,0.143,0.774,0.9997,False,True,1794,10,25,1794,10,25
